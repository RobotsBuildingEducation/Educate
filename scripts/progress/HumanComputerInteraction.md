## Interaction & Design

So first and foremost, UI/UX is short for user interfaces and user experiences. It’s a multi-disciplinary research and design skill based on the study of human-computer interaction. It’s an excellent skill to have as it can take many different shapes and sizes. For our intents and purposes, let’s define this skill as “Interaction Design” or simply “Design”.

Some people refer to this profession as the psychology of technology or the therapy of technology. This is because an interaction designer is going to be interviewing and observing a lot of real input from people to gather deeper insights into a product. They will hold surveys, polls, interviews and any number of ways to communicate to people in order to accomplish this.

The key thing I want to highlight in this lecture is that this design work extends far beyond visual design and brainstorming good or clever ideas. It’s an incredibly thoughtful practice that can be applied to many environments. An interaction designer enjoys solving these types of questions

How do you improve this restaurant’s experience?
Do AirBnB hosts who value this skill perform better?
Which trailer in a movie produces the most anticipation?
Which video title is more likely to go viral?

As you can see, this skill, combined with some technical or business acumen, can be a pretty powerful amplifier!

#### Accessibility

Let’s start with accessibility, one of my favorite subjects as an engineer. In the study of computer science, we tend to approach problem-solving by accounting for the worst possible outcome. We do it as a way to practice building scalable solutions with information and data. Accessibility is a subject that has us working with design principles in that matter.

So let’s start with a basic website. It will have all the familiar bells and whistles that we’re used to; some navigation, some buttons and some text inputs. So what else does an interaction designer take a look at other than placing familiar elements on a screen?

Well, let’s consider folks that are blind. They interact with applications using intelligent tools and screen readers. So now we have to consider organizing the information in a way that makes sense for both visual and auditory users.

Now the real benefit to this approach is that it’s often a win-win situation. Thoughtful creation for folks that experience limitations with accessibility often benefits folks without the limitation. For example, if a video lecture is organized in an effective way for blind folks, then people who are tuning in with just headphones can also experience information meaningfully! It’s considerations like this that made things like radio and podcasts such popular media formats for people of all backgrounds to consume.

Multidisciplinary
So hopefully that conversation has you curious about what design even means. You may notice there’s an umbrella of sorts covering a lot of topics. This is because human-computer interaction is fundamentally multidisciplinary. We tend to just talk about it within the context of technology given that technology is also multidisciplinary.

However, it’s all the same as a chemical engineer, a business owner, an architect or even a teacher and still find enormous value integrating the principles of design in your work.

The choices you make have a serious impact. The key words you choose can influence how search engines and social media algorithms distribute your material or how it gets consumed by an audience. The intent behind the features or expressions that you create can affect how successful retention is. It can give you a significant competitive advantage.

Because of the scale of the umbrella, it can be easy to justify something as “good or bad design”. It lends itself to opinion. The best design tends to be whatever makes the people you’re designing for happy and if you want to make even more people happy, well, you’re gonna have to talk to them! The rest is just research, and research is largely meant for discovery.

Many folks may go in another direction, where they start with the discovery part first and then try to convince folks that their solution is superior in some way. Nascent technologies like cryptocurrencies are notorious for this.

However, the study of design also lends itself to the study of new technologies. So hype waves around things like Bitcoin or artificial intelligence is a great time for newcomers to jump in and make contributions toward large problems.

#### Heuristics

Heuristics are essentially guidelines you can use while you create something with constraints or limited feedback. Some things are inevitably repeatable, like considering how a user can correct a mistake or malfunction. These are simply guidelines rather than rules or regulations. There’s an added benefit since they have a tendency to build or bounce off of another.

And these guidelines really introduce you to the practice of interaction design. It’s at this point where you start to learn lower level concepts like the usage of affordances, which are the signals or properties of an object and how that informs a user of its possibilities or potential use cases.

In a rather absurd sense, these concepts are the things that remind you that a water pitcher is meant for pouring water rather than it being a glove to protect your hand. They’re the details that help us realize that pixels on a screen are supposed to represent buttons that we can interact with.

And if you take some time to ponder that idea, you can really start to appreciate the little things in design. Why is that when we see a glove, we know it’s meant to protect our hands? What inspired a fork and a pair of chopsticks? Why did the iPhone get rid of the headphone jack?!

#### Design Systems

So let’s take a step back and review. We value accessibility because it’s fundamentally about enabling more people to do things. We understand that design research is multidisciplinary and encourages us to talk to people directly to gain more insight. We use guidelines to give us a sense of direction when developing ideas or products.

With these fundamentals in mind, it’s worth reviewing the number of ways you can gather insight or communicate your ideas. Much like engineering, your tool of choice is going to carry tradeoffs and consequences.

For example, the usage of paper prototypes may range wildly based on where it’s being seen - a boardroom and a Tiktok video carry different results. Finding the resources and budget to surveying may lead to skewed or biased results. Doing personal interviews may mislead your direction and be costly on a schedule. You may like a cheap tool you found on the internet more than some fancy enterprise software.

But over time you start you start to find what works well with you or with different teams. And it’s here where I can only advise you to think critically and keep an open mind.

#### Further Reading

Now if you enjoyed this subject, I highly recommend a few more follow-up sources. It’s worth your time to check out “The Design of Everyday Things” by Don Norman, who is widely revered in the field of human-computer interaction.

I also recommend using the resources available at nngroup.com, which is the Nielsen Norman Group. This is a knowledge base meant for the profession concerned with standards.

If you’re curious to see what real-world UX research looks like, you’re encouraged to join Bitcoin.design, which is an open-source platform that supports usability research & development for Bitcoin.

These three resources in combination will provide a deeper introduction into the process andd perspective of a designer.
