# Shitty First Draft

You likely recognize human-computer interaction (HCI) by its business application - user interfaces and user experiences. 
Human-computer interaction is ultimately a research position meant to understand how and why people use tools.

It isn't limited to just technology and can be applied in a number intersectional fields. So this work
is inclusive of architects, psychologists, computer scientists and a range of professionals that are
people and product driven.


If you want to see real world examples of human-computer interaction, I recommend that beginners
get involved with communities like Bitcoin.design, Norman-Nielsen Group or 
read quintessential reads like The Design of Everyday Things.


So let's break down some of the most important concepts in HCI: accessibility, heuristics, affordances and testing
