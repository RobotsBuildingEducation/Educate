# Outline

STORY
I graduated with a fairly competitive resume.
I was not getting interviews.
It was a problem with my resume.
I thought about UI/UX.
Changing it created much stronger results.
‚Äî
THE INTERFACE
This approach is highly opinionated.
Altering it is not recommended.
Everything is done with intention and purpose.
Some things to consider:
1. Your LinkedIn profile should be optimized for recruiter search. Titles and years of experiences are highly ranked.
2. Your resume should be effective in highlighting your candidacy in 6-10 seconds.
3. Your resume should offer insightful context into your career progress in 1-2 minutes.
4. Resume readers have inherent bias and expectations.
5. Not all good resumes pass and not all bad resumes fail! Don‚Äôt take things personal.
‚Äî
FORMAT
1. Spacing is strict.
2. Font highlighting is strict.
3. Order of information is strict.
What does this tell you in 6 seconds?
‚Äî
1 PAGE RULE
It signals effective communication. I recommend to avoid using fluff or filler. If you feel a fear of missing out, be more concise. Be honest. Honesty inspires confidence. 4. Qualifying information serves to empower confidence in interviews. If you are short a page, work with what you have. Sometimes you may need to work to add more.
‚Äî
Education
Add it to the top. Education is more of an expectation setter. It can be overshadowed. There is also advantage to dropping expectations and improving them. For example, a philosophy degree with a strong engineering resume is a good combination.

‚Äî
Skills

Honesty inspires confidence. ‚ÄúProficient‚Äù skills are skills you can genuinely geek out about. Explored skills are things you found interesting or productive.
‚Äì

Work
Beginners struggle here because it‚Äôs hard to create impact. Creating impact takes time. Early career people need to rely more on being business savvy - using relevant tools to get a job done, rather than using tools to improve work that already existed. Competitive advice: Network in person at events & participate in open-source projects. Professors are often have a strong network too! Good projects often have ‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù to get people introduced.

‚Äî

Projects
1 personal project. 1 business project. Let your personal project be about stuff you enjoy. Express creativity or exploration. Don‚Äôt worry about completion. Let your business project have some kind of scope. Deliver a minimum viable product. These days, building things with APIs and SDKs gets the message across. For example: building a Twitter and discord bot for an active social channel. See if you can get paid too! Why not?üòäüòÅ

Summary
Remember that a resume is fundamentally a document that communicates something about you. So effective communication is the main goal.



# Script


### Story

#### scene 1
One of the first problems I encountered after graduating from college was not
getting any calls back from employers. This didn‚Äôt really make sense to me since 
I was a qualified and competitive candidate on paper.

#### scene 2
The problem was my resume. It didn‚Äôt communicate that value well and I didn‚Äôt
communicate it in a way that made it helpful for the person organizing out 
applicants. I thought about my skill in user experiences and focused heavily 
on improving the communication part.

#### scene 3
These changes had significant outcomes. I started to get calls back 
from places like Tesla and other competitive employers after making the adjustments. 
So let‚Äôs break this down.

‚Äî

### Interface

#### scene 4
The important lesson here is to remember that a resume is a document meant 
to communicate your value proposition for a business. So it‚Äôs fundamentally 
a communication problem. This means it follows the same structure as telling 
a story or idea.

#### scene 5
The following interface is highly opinionated. Its intention and purpose is 
to educate a rookie resume writer on the challenge, since a competitive resume 
is often people‚Äôs first encounter with real-world business.

#### scene 6
Here are some other things to consider while learning this:

###### scene 6.1
- Your LinkedIn profile should be optimized for recruiter search tools. Titles 
and years of experience are highly ranked.

###### scene 6.2
- Your resume should be effective in highlighting your 
candidacy in 6-10 seconds.

###### scene 6.3
- Your resume should offer a productive conversation about your career progress 
in 30 seconds to 2 minutes

###### scene 6.4
- Resume readers have inherent bias and expectations and are subject to 
uncontrollable conditions like mood or experience.

###### scene 6.5
- Not all good resumes pass and not all bad resumes fail! Don‚Äôt 
take things personally.

‚Äî

### Format

#### scene 7
With that in place, let‚Äôs introduce the general format:

###### scene 7.1
- Spacing is strict

###### scene 7.2
Font highlighting is strict

###### scene 7.3
Order of information is strict

###### scene 8
Alright so the first real rule is the 1 page rule. In short, 
you have to be able to communicate your value effectively. The 
right practice here is to avoid using fluff and filler since that 
often takes away from effective communication. Instead, leaning on 
honesty will either inspire more confidence in later stages of the 
interview process or inspire you to develop your background more competitively. 

#### scene 9
One thing I often teach is that imposter syndrome is the result of 
holding yourself to a high standard while not always having all the 
resources to prepare enough for that standard. If you feel it while 
writing a resume, your best bet is to avoid using fluff or filler and 
to lean on honesty & confidence in order to guide your risk-taking & 
professional development.

### Education

#### scene 10
Next up is the education part. This is your introduction. Keep it 
simple and move on. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a community college, 
a vocational school, an online degree or an Ivy League. Slap it on and 
keep it moving.


### Skills

#### scene 11
This is a follow-up section to your education introduction. 
This section may not be necessary for some professions that 
aren‚Äôt heavily based on usage of tools like software engineering. 
I recommend to segment into two or three sections labeled ‚ÄúProficient‚Äù, 
‚ÄúExplored‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpoken‚Äù. Proficient skills should be things you can 
talk shop about with a professional. It should be a skill you‚Äôre 
comfortable with. Explored skills should highlight curiosity and 
engagement with tools you‚Äôve used in the past to accomplish meaningful 
things.


### Experience

#### scene 12
This is the main part. It's going to be challenging to follow conventional resume 
advice about making a significant impact at organizations at the entry level. 
If you are unable to do that, then consider defining the impact of your role 
at the company followed by the type of experience you gained at that role.


### Volunteering & Open Source Work

#### scene 13
The employment market is something that ebbs and flows with the conditions of 
the economy. Some career mentors will suggest things like projects, extracurriculars
or other endeavors like I once have, but in the competitive market of 2023, I would 
highly recommend searching for volunteer and open source experience. 

#### scene 14
There‚Äôs a number of reasons for this other than highlighting attributes about
your candidacy. Doing so also allows you to expand your network in meaningful ways.


### Conclusion

#### scene 15
With all of this in mind, what you‚Äôll get is a one sheet document that allows employers 
to quickly and effectively evaluate your candidacy through the lifecycle of an 
interview process. Again, it helps to treat a resume like a story, a video or 
some other communication piece. It should see multiple word-by-word revisions and 
its flow should feel good to go through. And as always, if you need extra help or
