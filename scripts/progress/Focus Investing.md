# Focused Investing

Investing in stocks is ultimately a science in making decisions. Focused investing is the practice I follow - so the most I can ultimately do for you here is provide you with timeless wisdom and examples of the practice so that you can start off on the right foot. So let's jump right into it.

### 1. Diversification is protection against ignorance.

Focused investing is the opposite of diversification. You should still start diversified. In general, the less aware you are, the more you should diversify. Protection against ignorance is an extremely powerful thing and you ought to get in the habit of realizing that you will always know very little relative to the ebbs and flows of information that exist.

Most people simply don't have the time to pour of books and readings, so they allow financial advisors to manage their funds via 401k retirement accounts or various highly regarded indexes and ETFs like the S&P500. These investments are essentially large bundles that are tied to the overall market performance.

**It's extremely important to start here.** It's the best starting position because you're more or less investing in an advanced algorithm that's selecting for the best possible average. That's a great deal for most people. If all your investments end up being diversified ones, that's fine. That's still focused investing if you make that informed decision.

But what's the next phase after that? Well, let's say you're extremely interested in investing in "green energy markets" or "cybersecurity markets". There are ETFs for that - so start there. But as you can see, you narrowed down an entire level with this practice already.

To summarize, you need to more or less understand the nature of numbers to appreciate diversification and it's complement, focused investing. Focused investing provides more volatility, but it's crucial to remember that volatility is not risk. Diversification is a reduction of volatility. In short, don't drive fast until you're a trained driver.


### 2. The more that you read, the more successful you will be.

At the end of the day, you're going to be reading encyclopedias of information as you build a network of knowledge of the moving pieces that exist within companies and the relationship they have to the market. This isn't to promote endless analysis before making a choice, although it may come to that like it did for me, but to promote exploration of ideas that you have.

You will inevitably read through numerous public market filings, annual reports and quarterly reports. You're going to inevitably start mapping out all of the numbers that govern the performance of a business. You will know when you've read enough about a company or market because your imagination and the creativity of your questions will simply plummet.

### 3. Control your bias

The single biggest problem you will have on this journey is controlling for bias. Bias in an extremely powerful and invisible force that governs our ability to make decisions. It's sneaky too - for example, someone may read the last wisdom and decide to read a book about Steve Jobs only to confirm their already existing bias about Apple and drive them toward investment. You need to be extremely careful here because this is pretty much the ultimate challenge you'll face as an investor.

One of the biggest challenges here is understanding what you think you know vs. what you think you know. If you're following me closley along, you'll start to make connections between protecting yourself from ignorance, reading a lot and controlling your understanding. It's a pretty good recipe for success if you ask me!

As always, I recommend listening to the Harvard Lecture by Charlie Munger called "The Psychology Of Human Misjudgement". I would argue it's one of the greatest lectures in history.

### 4. Understand incentives

Understanding incentives is the next most difficult challenge behind picking stocks. You need to understand why people do things. That is tricky and disappointing process and it as complicated as advanced multivariable calculus. But once you have a solid grasp of that, you know why organizations like Pinterest can exist happily along organizations like Instagram and Amazon.

Another key knowledge point here is understanding that changing the incentive changes the behavior. We as a species are simply hard-wired to adapt and take-risks, so changing the reason why people do that will help you understand why businesses are choosing to work on particular things.

This isn't simply a macro-level observation. For example, you wouldn't make inform decision because "electric vehicles are the future and people won't want to pay for gas". Although that's true, it's not particularly compelling. Understanding incentives will have you understand seemingly unreasonable market standards like American's unwillingness to exchange their iPhone devices. Understanding a company's incentives will ultimately have you understand whether or not you're in a safe place to invest money.


### 5. Study the greats

Similar to wisdom 2, you ought to pick the right role models and influences. This is true for anything, but particularly true for the stock market. As a general rule of thumb, the closer you are to money, the more value that trust has. So don't simply pick popular models, pick ones that worked hard to earn your trust.

I recommend to start with Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet, Jack Bogle and Cathie Wood. They are all exceptional figures in their own way that have greatly influenced many investors across time. They will provide other insights to consider. You may discover your own over time, but most would agree that there is meaningful information to be learned from these folks.

You could try not to study the greats and figure it out on your own. You may even get lucky too, but what you're ultimately doing is practicing the art of walking into an arena to get slaughtered by a lion. It's not a very reasonable decision.

### Conclusion

So to keep the practice going, I'm going to keep it to 5 simple points. It may take you years to process fully the depth here and they're really omnipresent pieces of wisdom that will help you as an investor or entrepeneur alike. I can continue on and on about other things, but investing in the stock market is ultimately an identity problem. You are different than me, and so is your temperament and risk-taking clock.

Like coding, the point isn't about just writing software - there's a bigger conversation here about how and why you invest in things that aren't stocks. These are your relationships, where you live, what you practice and any number of other time commitments that you make. If I had to offer one last piece of wisdom - fight like living hell to secure your right to health, time and space before money. Sometimes life has you focusing on money but keep your vision clear - you don't want to learn the hard way why health and time is more important. It'll keep you humble and honest.

So let's dive in shall we? What do I invest in and why?
