# Focused Investing

Investing in stocks is ultimately a science in making decisions. Focused investing is the practice I follow - so the most I can ultimately do for you here is provide you with timeless wisdom and examples of the practice so that you can start off on the right foot. So let's jump right into it.

### 1. Diversification is protection against ignorance.

Focused investing is the opposite of diversification. You should still start diversified. In general, the less aware you are, the more you should diversify. Protection against ignorance is an extremely powerful thing and you ought to get in the habit of realizing that you will always know very little relative to the ebbs and flows of information that exist.

Most people simply don't have the time to pour of books and readings, so they allow financial advisors to manage their funds via 401k retirement accounts or various highly regarded indexes and ETFs like the S&P500. These investments are essentially large bundles that are tied to the overall market performance.

**It's extremely important to start here.** It's the best starting position because you're more or less investing in an advanced algorithm that's selecting for the best possible average. That's a great deal for most people. If all your investments end up being diversified ones, that's fine. That's still focused investing if you make that informed decision.

But what's the next phase after that? Well, let's say you're extremely interested in investing in "green energy markets" or "cybersecurity markets". There are ETFs for that - so start there. But as you can see, you narrowed down an entire level with this practice already.

To summarize, you need to more or less understand the nature of numbers to appreciate diversification and it's complement, focused investing. Focused investing provides more volatility, but it's crucial to remember that volatility is not risk. Diversification is a reduction of volatility. In short, don't drive fast until you're a trained driver.


### 2. The more that you read, the more successful you will be.

At the end of the day, you're going to be reading encyclopedias of information as you build a network of knowledge of the moving pieces that exist within companies and the relationship they have to the market. This isn't to promote endless analysis before making a choice, although it may come to that like it did for me, but to promote exploration of ideas that you have.

You will inevitably read through numerous public market filings, annual reports and quarterly reports. You're going to inevitably start mapping out all of the numbers that govern the performance of a business. You will know when you've read enough about a company or market because your imagination and the creativity of your questions will simply plummet.

### 3. Control your bias

The single biggest problem you will have on this journey is controlling for bias. Bias in an extremely powerful and invisible force that governs our ability to make decisions. It's sneaky too - for example, someone may read the last wisdom and decide to read a book about Steve Jobs only to confirm their already existing bias about Apple and drive them toward investment. You need to be extremely careful here because this is pretty much the ultimate challenge you'll face as an investor.

One of the biggest challenges here is understanding what you think you know vs. what you think you know. If you're following me closley along, you'll start to make connections between protecting yourself from ignorance, reading a lot and controlling your understanding. It's a pretty good recipe for success if you ask me!

As always, I recommend listening to the Harvard Lecture by Charlie Munger called "The Psychology Of Human Misjudgement". I would argue it's one of the greatest lectures in history.

### 4. Understand incentives

Understanding incentives is the next most difficult challenge behind picking stocks. You need to understand why people do things. That is tricky and disappointing process and it as complicated as advanced multivariable calculus. But once you have a solid grasp of that, you know why organizations like Pinterest can exist happily along organizations like Instagram and Amazon.

Another key knowledge point here is understanding that changing the incentive changes the behavior. We as a species are simply hard-wired to adapt and take-risks, so changing the reason why people do that will help you understand why businesses are choosing to work on particular things.

This isn't simply a macro-level observation. For example, you wouldn't make inform decision because "electric vehicles are the future and people won't want to pay for gas". Although that's true, it's not particularly compelling. Understanding incentives will have you understand seemingly unreasonable market standards like American's unwillingness to exchange their iPhone devices. Understanding a company's incentives will ultimately have you understand whether or not you're in a safe place to invest money.


### 5. Study the greats

Similar to wisdom 2, you ought to pick the right role models and influences. This is true for anything, but particularly true for the stock market. As a general rule of thumb, the closer you are to money, the more value that trust has. So don't simply pick popular models, pick ones that worked hard to earn your trust.

I recommend to start with Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet, Jack Bogle and Cathie Wood. They are all exceptional figures in their own way that have greatly influenced many investors across time. They will provide other insights to consider. You may discover your own over time, but most would agree that there is meaningful information to be learned from these folks.

You could try not to study the greats and figure it out on your own. You may even get lucky too, but what you're ultimately doing is practicing the art of walking into an arena to get slaughtered by a lion. It's not a very reasonable decision.

### Conclusion

So to keep the practice going, I'm going to keep it to 5 simple points. It may take you years to process fully the depth here and they're really omnipresent pieces of wisdom that will help you as an investor or entrepeneur alike. I can continue on and on about other things, but investing in the stock market is ultimately an identity problem. You are different than me, and so is your temperament and risk-taking clock.

Like coding, the point isn't about just writing software - there's a bigger conversation here about how and why you invest in things that aren't stocks. These are your relationships, where you live, what you practice and any number of other time commitments that you make. If I had to offer one last piece of wisdom - fight like living hell to secure your right to health, time and space before money. Sometimes life has you focusing on money but keep your vision clear - you don't want to learn the hard way why health and time is more important. It'll keep you humble and honest.

So let's dive in shall we? What do I invest in and why?


# The Portfolio

In the spirit of the tradition, we're going to briefly cover my investments. In the future, there may be a better time and place to dive into all of these concepts more closely but for now, this should all take quite some time to really internalize. Before starting I want the reader to illustrate to remember an idea. Investing your money as an adult is essentially the equivalent of a child learning how to swim. Any fool can examine a deep body of water and understand that their is some inherent risk in trying to learn how to swim but the task is ultimately not that big of a deal. The same goes for investing. You typically just need some experience and guidance. I think a lot of people like to believe that investing is like jumping into a sea filled with sharks. It can be that if you want it to be but it's obviously a nonsensical thing to do to put yourself in that kind of situation.


One of the wisdoms I follow, not listed above, is one provided by Munger and Buffet. They suggest not to directly invest in things outside of your circle of competence.
This piece of wisdom took me a while to understand, which lead me to the advice I provided earlier about really taking the time to understand what you know vs. what you think you know.

So I invest in social media, financial technology and education technology. I believe those industries have non-trivial growth trajectories ahead of them and I believe that I can understand these investments better than the typical investor. Despite having a background in computer science, I don't expand into seemingly common sense investments like semiconductor chips or AI - but that simply points to the practice of investing in what you truly know. I don't truly spend too much time working on AI or pouring over modern advancements so I don't extend myself in those directions!

When it comes to these industries, I generally invest in assets that are offered at fair or good prices. This is another wisdom not listed about investing in wonderful companies at fair prices, rather than fair companies at wonderful prices. But what is wonderful? In my opinion, it's some combination of having deep market penetration, a profoundly good reputation and excellent product marketing.

These are great American companies like Costco, Apple, Disney and the sort. We may recognize the value of the brands, but why is it that we recognize these brands so much?
So when it comes to applying these concepts, I've ultimately boiled it down to primarily 5 investments. And if you're wondering, yes I've done deep reading on every company, their financials, their history, their leaders and the overarching stories:

1. Pinterest
2. Block
3. Duolingo
4. Berkshire Hathaway
5. Apple

### Understanding Pinterest & Social Media
https://profitviz.com/PINS

Well before going into Pinterest, let's understand the basics of social media. All of social media exists on some kind of "scale of intention" ranging from direct action to passive entertainment. So applications like Discord, Google and Pinterest are going to be geared toward pre-determined customers goals; they're social tools. Other platforms will likely be geared toward some form of entertainment like Tiktok or Instagram. They're passive tools where people enjoy spending their idle time. 

Now social media has a super set, which is the creator economy, and that's much larger in scope. The creator economy can even be inclusive of things like Roblox, AirBnB or even this simple AI tutor. A creator is a digital-first entrepeneur. There are many too many ways to measure success in the creator economy and I personally believe that millenials and younger generations should really be proud of creating such a fascinating slice of the pie.

Pinterest lies in a healthy place in the creator economy. It's customers love to use the application for the right reasons and it's primarily driven by women. In short, it's a shopping application. Underneath that it's an idea search engine and a place to collect plans. This combination of things places it uniquely in the creator economy.

Let me ask the reader this - if you had to choose one tool to plan the best version of a child's birthday party; would you use Pinterest, Amazon or Google? What about a wedding, or a vacation? The thing about these question is that it's not immediately obvious, and that is economically profound when you realize that Google and Amazon are both nearly 10,000%+ or 100x+ larger than Pinterest.

So despite being smaller, and theoretically more volatile, you end up in a pleasant situation where a reputable company continues to grow in a manner that is clear-sighted. Before Pinterest is concerned with social influence, it's concerned with providing it's customers a useful service. This creates a very simple business to understand and the second order effects of these relationships results in highly curated ads. Customers on Pinterest are directly interested in the ads rather than it being a competing space for time and attention.

Financially, this theory is playing out well. Pinterest has an impressive outreach of 400M-500M monthly users with a healthy balance sheet. Many other social media competitors of a similar size like Snapchat, Spotify, Discord, Reddit X seemingly struggle in comparison, and for good reason - they're incentivized around capturing attention and building an economy around it - of which Google and Meta are heavyweights.

So the theory is ultimately pretty simple. Pinterest is a predictable business and as long as it remains highly reputable and useful, it becomes a pretty good social media investment that can responsibly manage heavy allocation.


###  Understanding Block & Financial Technology
https://profitviz.com/SQ

So over time, you'll notice that my investment strategy tends to revolve around the "next best opportunity" rather than the current incumbents. This means that I like trying to formulate which opportunities are likely to be the next generation of competitors. This is the reason why I tend to have seemingly random investments like Roblox. Block is one of those investments. I believe there's an opportunity that it can become the next generation "JP Morgan Chase or Visa".

Investing in financial technology is honestly pretty complex. For example, if you want to understand the distribution of financial services, you need to understand the regulatory frameworks that allow those pipelines to be built. This goes back to our first principle - reading is going to lead to success. However, for now, let's make this break down the complex and then follow it with something more simple to understand.

The theory here is that technology is clearly a creative facilitator and improver of previous financial systems. That part is clear as day and a simple sign of that is the improvement of large banking applications like Chase and the rise of smaller neobanks like Robinhood. The important key here is the fact that technology is a **creative** facilitator and will thus be a crucial part to the larger creator economy. Block, I believe, understands this much more clearly than its peer organizations like Paypal, Robinhood or even Shopify. It is important for me to distinguish that Block isn't the only organization that understands this, but Block understands it best.

I'll ask to the reader to really think deeply about this. What is finance? What use does it serve to the world? It's just a man made construct - it doesn't fundamentally achieve anything other than a system that we're usually in agreement with. Art is similar in that regard in the sense that it doesn't fundamentally critical for our survival like the production of food or the maintenance of clean water.

But it's important to appreciate these elements of the economy. These are facilitating forces. This is actually why Block investing in TIDAL was a pretty wise thing to do, since it builds organic relationships with a critical part to the creator economy. Cultural and social capital, if wielded well, keeps an organization relevant across changes over time. Many in the industry look for the famous iPhone moment, but I would suggest to consider the iPod moments too :) 

Other than the cultural and regulatory complexity, let's review the simple to understand parts about financial services. Deposits and credit facilitation is important. Building deposits allows companies to create lending and credit capacity. It's a profoundly simple concept. Businesses will have various ways to incentivize customers to keep their deposits at their institution organization. 

For the sake of review - we can observe that new institutions like Robinhood incentivize their customers by offering financial instruments in the stock market. Block primarily incentivises deposits for simple app transactions on Cash App and Square incentives deposits via small business growth. Again, I encourage readers to appreciate the simplicity of these things. I would also encourage you to consider how some features like "direct deposits" is actually a deeply competitive thing - because if Cash App is getting your employer deposit, that's a whole deposit that Chase bank suddenly misses on their balance sheet! 

It's this simplicity that actually makes financial services failure so epicly nonsensical. There is almost no case where financial institution fail unless they engage in extremely wreckless behavior, because the foundation of financial services is ultimately being a good steward of money created and distributed. This has historically been true from the fall of Silicon Valley Bank to the infamous financial market meltdown of 2008. So therein lies the reality of choosing a good financial service - they must be superb financial stewards. Keeping things simple is the right way.

Now the real meat and bones behind Block is their research behind Bitcoin. This brings us to discussions related to disruptive theories. I don't want to spend too much time their, but this is really where focused investing comes into play. There is a lot I can say about Bitcoin but I think at this point we can ultimately view it, or its consequence, as an inevitable. I believe that Block is built in such a manner that they're most likely to achieve the right outcome. Block is appopriately focused on the decentralized network aspect rather than the programmable money aspect. This focus is what may ultimately have them competing directly with financial networks like Visa, which is greater than 1000% or 10x of Block's current size.

Why am I convinced of this? Well, again, it's pretty simple. Block serves small businesses on and offline. Many small businesses today are part of this digital-first entrepeneur ethos for the creator economy. Looking back at history, we can observe how network injustices can harm businesses, ranging from the legal shutdown of Tiktok to billionaire buyouts of platforms like Twitter. At a microlevel, we can observe simple bans, restrictions or other algorithmic serving demands and their consequences on business income.

Block isn't the only financial service that is digitally native and acutely aware of the times. Shopify is another particular company in the same realm that is arguably more successful online. But therein lies my appreciation for Blocks approach - I think there is something uniquely special about technology companies that build solutions for the real world.


###  Understanding Duolingo & Education Technology

Sheesh, that was a lot to cover. Education technology, fortunately, is much easier to understand. Interestingly, education technology is one of those things that baffles technologists becomes it's pretty difficult to disrupt the classroom. This is something I've dedicated a lot of time to understand.

It's difficult to change the classroom because the classroom has bizarre relationships with community, culture, parenting and things outside of its control. So developing technology for the classroom often falls short of expectations, and it isn't really clear how to create technology for those external influences. This is why, despite several technological revolutions and increased convenience, the classroom remains awfully resilient.

So after many years it became clear where and how to value technology. You don't look for the revolutions - you look for the obvious. You look at the first mile. Duolingo achieves significant growth over its competitors because it honed in on one key market - literacy.

So investing in duolingo is investing in literacy technology. We obviously recognize their product design around learning language but it takes seeing their expansion to see that clearly. The language software then fuels growth for math literacy and music literacy. These in turn can then begin to design cirriculum around either more advanced or hobbyist learning like coding, accounting or any number of things. And some folks may struggle to see how this is a compelling market, but you ought to consider the nature of global economics and rising middle class incomes. There is a natural flywheel here with people engaging in a more productive world.

Another key insight to understanding education technology is ultimately understanding human-computer interaction or user experiences. Most in the industry have a novice understanding of this and immediately jump or conclude to "gamifying" education. What I would always say is that you're just creating a bad game when you do that. Duolingo, despite being recognized as "heavily gamified", is mostly concerned with creating an appropriately immersive experience. And the way I like to conclude my overall thinking about education technology is with one simple statement; what else is education other than a student's experience?
