## My History With Bitcoin

The year was 2015 in Chicago and I was a computer science student in an operating systems course. I was working  in a screw manufacturer with machines and robotics. My friend had come over to consume some cannabis and we began a regular conversation over graphics cards available in the market.

We had this conversation because it would often be the case that I was gaming online with old computer hardware and this would limit my experiences. This time was a little different. AMD had released some modern cards at an affordable price. We talked about how gaming was getting ubiquitous worldwide and how it made sense to improve access. Little did we know that we would see these products experience regular shortages in the future.

This conversation would last for many years. We learned that you could do this process called mining to acquire these Ethereum tokens. We explored business ideas around these kinds of things. I didn’t really need to be convinced of the value of digital currency at the time. It had been 10 years of understanding that you can convert your real world money into digital tokens to purchase premium products with online games.

Blockchain-based currency was different since these gaming transactions were often one-way transactions. Once I converted my money into game currency, it was almost impossible to convert it back. This invented an illicit market of “gold farmers” in many online video games, which were exchange brokers that broke the rules of the game in order to sell gaming currency for real dollars. A similar reality was true for many artists who suddenly lost revenue due to peer-to-peer sharing on unregulated networks.

However, this required an unaccountable relationship of trust and security. It lead to problems for a number of industries and it was against the policies and regulations that businesses had to follow to prevent crime when operating card networks. There were many interesting economic realities that online video games and peer-networks produced, but it was clear that there were some limitations as a result of how early these institutions were to internet software. Keep in mind that these gold farming markets were in 2005! We didn’t really have a cohesive understanding with collaborating online. Most folks didn’t spend much time online.

What had convinced me to adopt a long-term view was the understanding that the network depended on a collection of miners that had a strong relationship with energy and heat. I thought it was a beautifully done process. It was clear to me that there was a future where these machines would upgrade or transform. Needless to say, I found the Proof-of-Work approach fascinating in its potential, but it was also easy to view a lot of technology that way. We really didn't know what was going to happen.

One has to remember that I’m an individual that essentially aged alongside the commercial internet and folks like us are eager and driven to see changes in a number of sectors. We are hopeful for the future and the outcomes created by these solutions. Bitcoin is something that sits brightly between intersections of energy policy, robotics, social networks or even cannabis policy.


That was all for some time. That was my introduction to the markets. Being a gamer and a computer science student gave me an edge in the consumer tech market. I was still this individual without much to work with so my best move was to watch and learn. Bitcoin and its associated markets were still very volatile and it wasn’t really a winning bet for me at the time regardless of what transpired in the markets. I didn’t know enough. I did know that it would be unwise to discount or discredit the invention. I still had time.


I graduated from college some years later and moved to the Bay Area. I ended up working at a financial technology startup. This exposed me to the regulatory environment around banking and financial networks. My manager was also quite a believer in Bitcoin. He talked about it in relation to the principles of investing. It was a good place for me to learn things about money.
 
This period of my life became a peculiar intersection of events. I became a pretty battle-hardened software engineer that adapted quickly to the changes brought by the COVID lockdowns. Digital collaboration wasn’t a foreign concept for me or many folks my age. It was quietly preferred for many of us. It was crucial to the success of the economy in some ways.
I became a writer on the side and started what was going to be my career as a creator. I wrote about the optimistic future of technology and the organizations that will drive us in that direction. I worked on my business. I began to understand social media, its constraints and gateways in ways I was unfamiliar with. I also began to learn a lot about the art of investing in a serious way. It was apparent that my advantage was in the tech market but I was not skilled enough yet to make big choices. It would ultimately narrow down to social media, financial and education technology investments.

## The Product

This all happened before and after the events that transpired with Bitcoin in 2020. It wasn’t really until closer to the year 2021 when I turned my head toward Bitcoin after the company Square had acquired TIDAL and placed Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter to the board.
 
It wasn’t until 2022 that I began to appreciate the potential of Bitcoin’s future after taking some time to understand a white-paper written by Block and its approach to decentralizing networks with the company they created called TBD. That was the mysterious software ecosystem that many folks like me patiently awaited for. There wasn’t as much time anymore.
 
And it was in 2023 where we arrive today with the advent of generative AI and recommended social feeds. At this point, it’s pretty clear for anyone that is following what we are going to see. We’re going to see competition between networks. We’ve been seeing it.

To those that like a good prediction, it’s likely that we will see the ability to transact between applications like Cash App and Coinbase. It would become a process no different than a Gmail sender being able to deliver a message to Yahoo Mail recipients.
 
The same is built for social media. There are early signs that these mechanisms work after Instagram’s successful launch and onboarding for Threads. It’s in the best interest of the user to have these networks decentralized in a way where people are the owners of the publications and relationships rather than the platforms - since the platforms do not provide you those things - they are earned and created by people interacting. There is a non-trivial need for this, since there are a growing amount of people that depend on these communication technologies for their income.

And Block is at the center of this. It wants to be a good steward of the internet and its financial networks are a gateway to achieve that. Bitcoin, at the end of the day, may be a system that most consumers aren’t interfacing with, the same way most people aren't all too concerned with the details for treasury bills when exchanging in the value of a dollar. The same could be said for sending emails. Users aren’t really concerned with the protocols underneath it that transmit the data, they’re interested in the service.

That’s the foundation of financial services. You need to create incentives to entrust, transact or deposit money. Block is unique in how they’re seen as an innovative company, yet they operate in a rather simple and pragmatic manner for their day-to-day. There isn't too much risk associated with their clientele. Block is the kind of company that works when a merchant has a cardboard sign with a $cashtag address written on it. There aren’t many shiny objects.
 
I believe that’s what Jack, the founder of Block and Twitter, means by Bitcoin being the native currency of the internet. There will be new services and ways to interface with applications without the same limitations created by centralized services, banks and card networks. These unlocks can become liberating mechanisms for consumers and merchants.

## The Social
The United States had recently exited the world war as a global power and went through an era of reforming global geopolitics under its influence. A lot of recent American history can be understood under that context. Oversimplifying, there were two global powers after the world war and they had competing economic policies. One can assume that the greater system would likely result in the greater or more productive military over a period of time. There’s a number of ways to opine or produce a narrative around history. Either way, the American military was more influential. Society changed in unique ways.
 
This influence relationship applied domestically and internationally. It was a time of expressing power over supply chains. In the US, it meant containment through drug war. It also suggested a reworking of monetary standards away from gold and toward dollar-based trust. These implementations were almost immediately after the Civil Rights Act, invoking a new era of control.
 
By this time, designing powerful communication networks was no longer unknown. It was rapidly applied to the financial pipelines. It was policies written in the Bank Secrecy Act that governed these transactions and thus began a long legacy of controls and monitors in the name of preventing crime. It created a network to determine and score trust amongst civilians, criminals, terrorists and enemies of state. This continues today with sophisticated algorithms to handle the level of scale these operations have become.

And at this point it really isn’t much of a debate to see the consequences of these policies. Academics in humanities will typically accept the common sense premise that racism and expressions of power didn’t suddenly vanquish due to the outcomes brought by Martin Luther King and the success of the Civil Rights movement. Economics is not a simple linear progression. We can see the outcomes of Black American families that were effectively subjugated economically by these policies. It can also be similarly witnessed in the suppression of Latin American economies.
 
This model ultimately backtracks to before the Civil Rights and after the Patriot Act . Our new financial standards created a system dependent on trust. The more trusted you were by the owners of the networks and reserves, the more access you had to capital systems. The longer you’ve participated in these networks, the more likely you’ve gathered trust. These underfunded schools, unbanked societies and our attitudes toward civil development are informed by this reality and what it incentivizes. One could eventually draw the connection that the system that produced the inequity was the same one that allowed culture to express their experiences in it through now-American staples like rap and hip-hop.

But obviously, people are largely unconcerned with committing crimes with these kinds of transactions. This creates a disconnection. Using cash gives you privacy but technology and networks do not. Cash doesn’t require verification, but cards do. Cards are convenient despite this, but it’s clear that the medium of exchange is transforming. The next stage seems to be the legitimization of cards as money, and this is why Bitcoin is often referred to as true digital cash.
 
Increasing the privacy of digital transactions would thus facilitate interactions we have yet to really experience online. Our current pipelines do not allow this to happen. This is what is known as trustless interactions. The system leaves trust up to its users. Again, the user often does not see what happens or upgrades behind the scenes, but our current pipelines also do not allow for service to be built - so what happens in the background is important.

This reality is what defines the vision and culture behind Block. It can create new pipelines. What drives the organization is building solutions that solve problems related to financial access and inclusion. The company can’t be understood otherwise. Its attitude toward financial services is different from other vendors. As such, it’s important to value the principles of diversity, access and history when accounting for the direction Block will take. One needs to appreciate the outcomes of working in the economics of oppression.
 
As a result, Block ties itself to the legacy and struggle that Black Americans and other minority groups experience, and this can be observed at all levels of the organization. Block is not your traditional Silicon Valley dream - its products are grounded by reality and the needs of main street. These seemingly random events, like the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador, are especially relative and share a common economic story.

There is this accessibility principle that I teach about how creating access for those who need it creates access for those who didn’t ask for it. I often provide the example that designing information to be read clearly by a screen reader may benefit those who read the same information since it’s well organized. I relate it to the advent of radio and podcast and how new mediums may change the experiences we participate in or appreciate. The same could be said for restrictive or liberating laws, policies and social codes.
 
Block, in many ways, positions itself by providing solutions to alleviate the cost of poverty by developing sound solutions inspired by Bitcoin and financial services for local economies. As a result, what you saw was Cash App popularized originally in spaces where oppression economics are highest in the United States, which would be impoverished inner cities in the southern US. It was accepted and embedded into cultures that inform and influence what we recognize as “Gen Z” or younger digitally native culture.
 
This outcome isn’t some kind of master plan devised by someone. It’s the outcome of the simple reality that the organization started by selling hardware to accept and bridge payment cards through internet connected phones. To accept cash with technology. In some ways, developing Bitcoin software is also a revolution of the company itself, where they’re repeating the same steps they took when they started building bridges. In short, the company started solving a financial access problem and continued to expand from that founding principle. The intersection is an act of nature.
 
Block capturing this market position and social reputation is nothing short of a phenomenon. It’s one that many companies don’t have the privilege of achieving. Its creative positioning is exactly what allows it to be a disruptive force over the long term. This positioning is not all too different from the gateways that Apple accessed with the iPod and its transformation into the iPhone.

And thus I believe that Block’s acquisition of TIDAL and their partnership with Shawn Carter is a historic one. It’s a unique relationship between visionaries across technical and social landscapes that can’t be replicated by other financial institutions. It’s an act of legacy and an act to actualize historic outcomes for the betterment of society. You could argue that investing in TIDAL with current conditions would be like investing in the value of hip-hop.
 
I believe the typical wall street analyst undervalues the potential generated by this relationship and thus misses the point or even the purpose that drives Block’s underlying growth. Block wants to repair old economies and introduce new ones and it wants to do it from an approach that creates fairness and equilibrium. It wants to change the game.

## The Future
Block is a predictable business. They want to right financial wrongs. It, like many of their peers, wants to improve the internet. In the short term, you’ll see it enter nascent but influential local markets like cannabis or beauty. You’ll see them facilitate small but accessible loans or meaningful alternatives. Their advertisements will be popular, impactful and welcomed. You’ll find them from local restaurants all the way up to arena conacerts.

In the long term, you’ll see them continue to apply the same financial inclusion model to continue to grow. You really have to ask what the point is at a certain level. What does it mean in the world if Block is a 300 billion dollar company that competes with organizations like Chase or Visa? Why would that outcome occur?
 
In my view, the same financial inclusion pattern would apply at scale. They may foray into larger trust applications and solve problems related to housing or even government scale enterprise. It may be an organization as influential as Universal Music Group or other art & entertainment networks. It may capture or invent markets we are not yet aware of.

Regardless, we know that the fundamentals of banking and financial services is financial stewardship. These institutions must be trusted to upkeep the financial pipelines that fuel economic activity. Block is ultimately a platform to help its customers secure wealth. It doesn’t seem all too driven by financial gains when it seeks to innovate. The organization, from its leadership down to its marketing, seems to be focused on the creation of fair playing fields, so it invokes a sense of trust for the future.

## Conclusion
In short, Block is an organization that unlocks new networks and focuses on securing wealth for its customers by creating useful tools and opportunities. It has a unique reputation in the market and a strong relationship with their customers. It is eager to use the trust they’ve cultivated to introduce new ideas that challenge older ways of transacting data or money across networks. For how epic the vision is, the organization takes an awfully modest approach to business-as-usual by being fairly pragmatic with innovation. The leadership and culture is visionary so it is not distracted by the shiny objects along the way. Block is a company that’s focused on building well-oiled pipelines that can play a key part in the future of US economics.
