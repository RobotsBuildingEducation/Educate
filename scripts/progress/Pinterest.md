Understanding incentives is a subject you’ll need to question and learn in order to understand and pick apart businesses. Incentives are drivers for economic behavior.

Pinterest is a company I like to use to understand incentives. Immediately, many novice investors may ask questions like, “Why would you invest in Pinterest when Tiktok or Meta exists?” and I like to answer this question by asking, “What drives you to shop at Target or Costco?”. It’s there where we can start to look at different concepts like psychological bias and other economic consequences that drive our consumer behavior. So let’s ask the question, why do we use Pinterest when Meta or Tiktok exists?

The Mental Model
<img width="674" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/1fa18dcb-f66e-422f-a267-16453744ba41">

Let’s start with a simple mental model to understand where we are on the internet. Social networks are a subset of communication technologies and these communication platforms create a network known as the internet. Communication platforms tend to range from intention to entertainment. This spectrum isn’t linear, sometimes entertainment platforms can be intentional. Sometimes tools can be entertaining. I want us to think really abstractly about what communication even means. It’s the source of a lot of change and movement. 

For example, a singer like Beyoncé can clearly sing for our entertainment, but what happens if a singer is suddenly protesting some social issue? Suddenly this entertainer becomes intentful in her communications. So platforms aren’t always one-dimensional, but a lot of these platforms are going to be driven by the data that informs it. This is what we know as the algorithm. For that reason, platforms like Instagram and Pinterest tend to have more curation in their distribution while platforms like Tiktok or Snapchat may be more candid or “lo-fi” in their approach. We can ponder why that is and you’ll come up with various potential answers.

So this is why we use different social platforms. They fulfill the needs of their customers for different reasons and they have genuine moats around those services. This is why Google, despite its size and influence, were unable to compete with the social nature of Facebook, a platform designed around connection. This may also explain why Pinterest can still perform impressively well despite sharing space with platforms like Tiktok, Google, Instagram or even Amazon.


Data & Design
But how? How did Pinterest accomplish a moat? Let’s start with how the data originated. In its early days, Pinterest was a platform where content was shared, collected and curated by its users. These pins fulfilled some private and organizational needs for the users. They were popular vision boards. Plans.

Over time, this need transformed into a visual search engine. This search engine became recognized as a search engine for ideas. It was at this point where Pinterest really started to grow its word-of-mouth reputation as a useful utility for people’s homes.

And now, we are in the era where this platform transforms yet again, especially with the advent of creative media - where the platform seeks to transform itself into a shopping platform. So Pinterest, from the perspective of its customers, lets them discover ideas, plan and execute those ideas.

And you might be thinking, well, doesn’t a platform like Amazon do that? And the answer is yes, which is why I see a platform like Pinterest closer to competing with organizations like Google & Amazon rather than entertainment platforms like Meta and Tiktok. Pinterest is geared toward intentional communication.

Macroeconomics
There’s a lot of potential and promise behind Pinterest’s current market value. Another moat-building outcome is that the platform is overwhelmingly used by women, such that expansion to any country almost guarantees that nearly 50% of the adult population are monthly active users. 

The only real plausible explanation for this is that Pinterest is a platform that delivers on the promise of its design and users develop a high form of trust with the platform, resulting in word-of-mouth adoption. What this means is that the value-per-pixel in its advertising space is higher than the average of other advertising spaces; Pinterest is a platform designed around high-quality outcomes.

In recent history, this theory was back tested and strongly signaled by potential acquisitions from Microsoft and Paypal for upwards 45 billion dollars. The final outcome seemingly appeared that Paypal’s COO, formerly Venmo CEO, became the new CEO of Pinterest, while the founder moved into the role of executive chairman of the board while researching the future psychological-health technology. These are significant movements toward monetization.

What you may notice here with Pinterest is that the story tends to just make sense. It is my belief that Pinterest remains a strong acquisition for organizations like Target or Amazon since this platform may transform into a disruptive competitor - how?

The Future
Many investors have the habit of avoiding good opportunities or overcomplicating potential opportunities when new-fangled technology arrives to the markets. One such case is the uncertain strategies surrounding AI investments. Pinterest is one such investment. Given the nature of the platform and its history, it’s clear that Pinterest has a very real possibility of competing with global organizations like SHEIN, Tiktok Shop and other AI-powered shopping channels.

This is one of the reasons I liken Pinterest to the business of Costco. Customers tend to enter and leave the platform happily. They follow an internal philosophy to achieve quality selection. The distribution is also intentional and meaningful. A quick browse just now has briefly introduced ads about Visa, Southwest Airlines and Expedia. A search for kitchen ideas presents an entire browsing section aligned with Amazon ads.

Now the truth is, every business is going to experience some level of churn. We hear complaints from customers about the “old version” of services and it's a very real problem that businesses need to solve. You could survey 1000 American Tik Tok users at the beginning of the launch of Tik Tok Shops and a year later and see various different outcomes and attitudes.

It is my view that Pinterest will find good ways to manage that problem and users will adapt to the changes around advertising, shopping and marketing. I think a healthy outcome would be if this combination encouraged more people to post organically, spurring the creation of successful creator businesses and an alternative yet focused service that stays away from the chaos of other social platforms.


Conclusion
In short, there’s a lot of potential and promise behind Pinterest’s current market value and the total addressable market surrounding retail, advertising and payments. The history and path ahead appears well-poised for success. Its current valuation appears to reflect that of a wonderful company at a fair price. The position of the business is fundamentally sound and simple to understand. The moat it maintains relative to its titan-sized competitors is visible. I believe it’s a strong acquisition target if not a company that successfully multiplies its growth and presence as a reliable American brand. Pinterest is a reasonable way to invest in the realm of social media.
