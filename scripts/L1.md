Subjects

### ðŸš§ Slow down.

Intro

Okay so boom, let's learn how to code. Here are the subjects we're gonna tackle

1. Coding and Logic
2. Data and Functions
3. Loops
4. Creating Objects
5. Network Functions

So coding and logic. Let's make this our first foundation - we're going to use it everywhere. Coding or programming is just the organization of information. Logic is just figuring out if something is true or false.

Let's internalize that thought. We don't need to write code to understand that. Look around you, things are organized and that organization defines some set of true or false values that ends up logically defines your reality ðŸ‘€. For example, is your screen bright? Do you have glasses on? Are you drinking something right now? Pretty cool right? Well, that's basically what you're going to do with code. Computers think in true and false values and you more or less organize your information around that concept.

On a side note, it's really important that I explain things in simple terms sometimes. Some people might feel like that's a little slow, but it's worth pacing yourself slower on some concepts. There's also so many different types of circumstances people experience that sometimes I need to figure out how to explain things for people that don't feel confident with computers, while also making it thoughtful enough for people that might "get it" quickly. So let's relax and enjoy this for what it is - community enrichment.

That being said, if the concept about logic was interesting to you, there's a course called discrete mathematics that we can ask ms. roxana to help us with in the app. It's a course you take early in your computer science study and you learn about the philosophy of logic and cool stuff like that. I like it because it makes me a better gamer, economist and poker player.
