Lessons covered:

- Operating systems & machines
- Backend Clouds
- Database foundations
- Creating users


As always, let's work our way backward. By the end of this lesson, we're going to understand how to define users in applications.
Let's highlight on of the key truths about computer science - we use technology to model the real world. This lesson is going to 
be pretty conceptual, so let's go into imagination mode. (outfit changes)

Operating systems is kinda where computer science lives. I often suggest to students that they should think about what machines they want to work on before considering a programming language for this reason. I think sometimes people limit the range of where software engineering can exist, and this is the space where you can jump from a macbook to a bitcoin miner to a tesla robot.

So let's step away from computers and let's think about something more simple, like a kitchen.
