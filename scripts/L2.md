# Lesson 2 - The Frontend

GPT-4L Event Driven Programming


## Intro

Okay let's quickly review lesson one,
We took at look at the fundamentals of organizing data with code.
We learned about objects, functions, loops and logic.

One of the examples we saw there was a version of a class that we call a component. 
Components are a popular way to create user interface and experiences.

```jsx
let Tweet = ({ tweet }) => {
  let [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)


  let createLike = () => {     
     setLiked(true)
  }
 
  return(
    <section>

      <img src={tweet.user.photo_id} />
      
      <bold>{tweet.user.name}</bold>
      <icon>{tweet.user.isVerified}</icon>
      <label>{tweet.user.handle}</label>
      <label>{tweet.user.age_of_tweet}</label>
       
      <section>{tweet.text}</section>
      
      <label>{tweet.total_comments}</label>
      <label>{tweet.total_retweets}</label>
      
      <label onClick={createLike}>
        {tweet.total_likes}
      </label>

    </section>
  )
 }

```

I used to find a lot of trouble back in the day when I would 
suggest to people that they're better off just learning a skill like React 
instead the traditional HTML/CSS/Javascript but that claim mostly comes from a place of wisdom rather than tradition. We'll get to that later.

So before explaining React, let's just create a simple model. Our phones are these remote controls for the digital world.
When we use these apps, we change the state of our experiences in the digital world. That's pretty true right?

So when you think about those elements in an app, and the way that you interact with them, you create these reactions where state of the user interface or experience has changed.
That's React programming. 

These are the main parts of a react component:

1. You have the component's hooks
2. You have the component's state
3. You have the component's properties

As always, let's keep things simple. Hooks are functions that handles and updates the state of a component. I like to think about them like levers, 
where using the levers will result in the machine changing. But if you look at our digital remote example from earlier, using hooks would be the button pressing event of the remote.


Next is the state. The state is essentially the dynamic data that you're managing. It's the data that you expect to change because either machines or people are using it.
In short, when you change the state of the component, you're refreshing the display of it and causing the component to render again.

Now here's where I rewind back to our conversation about learning React before HTML/CSS/Javascript. I don't believe there's anything wrong with doing it the traditional way,
but I really think it's worth observing **why** React, or other component-based programming frameworks ended up completely dominating and uplifting the field. They're really 
wonderful pieces of technology under the hood and I would encourage you all to study the programming languages internals and history along the way.

Well, I guess this might just be me getting older and appreciating the little details of things, 
but isn't it kind of cool that programming languages translate things like `["hello", world"] translate to `new Array()`?
or, in React's case, `<header>Hello World</header>`, it translates to `React.createElement("header", null, "Hello World")

Anway, let's stay on task. Now the last part of a component we really need to understand are the properties of the component. Let's change our tweet component.

```

// we have the tweet property. We don't change it.
let Tweet = ({ tweet }) => {

  // state, defined by a useState hook
  let [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)


  // event that changes and updates states
  let createLike = () => {     
     setLiked(true)
  }
 
 
 // the component render/display
  return(
    <section>
      <img src={tweet.user.photo_id} />
      
      <bold>{tweet.user.name}</bold>
      <icon>{tweet.user.isVerified}</icon>

      <label>{tweet.user.age_of_tweet}</label>
      
      <Tweet
       
      <section>{tweet.text}</section>
      
      <label>{tweet.total_comments}</label>
      <label>{tweet.total_retweets}</label>
      
      <label onClick={createLike}>
        {tweet.total_likes}
      </label>

    </section>
  )
 }


```


```      
let Tweet = ({ tweet }) => {

  // state, defined by a useState hook
  let [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)
  let [tweetCopy, setTweetCopy] = useState(tweet);


  // event that changes and updates states
  let createLike = () => {     
     setLiked(true);
     
     setTweetCopy({
        ...tweetCopy,
        total_likes: tweetCopy.total_likes + 1
     })
    
  }
  
  
 
 // the component render/display
  return(
    <section>
      <TweetHeader 
          photo_id={tweet.user.photo_id}
          name={tweet.user.name}
          isVerified={tweet.user.isVerified}
          handle={tweet.user.handle}
          age_of_tweet={tweet.user.age_of_tweet}
       />
      
      <TweetContent
        tweet={tweetCopy}
      />
       

      <TweetCommands 
        tweet={tweetCopy}
        createLike={createLike}
        liked={liked}
      />
      


    </section>
  )
 }
```

So you might be looking at this code and thinking how some of it makes sense, but some of it is also too much. That's normal, yeah, because what you're really doing when you put hooks, state and properties together is a data model. You're looking at so many other things, like the flow of data, or all the little rules you might not be aware of. Like, why don't we change properties? Why do we only change state? When do we create copies of properties as state, so that we can safely change values as needed?


Wait hold on, pause. Look at you. You're engineering software. All those questions that you just asked are things you'll have to work through to answer, and that's exactly what software engineering is. It's not about writing code as much as it is planning it. Isn't that cool? How you feel right now is how professional software engineers sometimes feel too! So good job.


So here's the real bread and butter to becoming a React expert, and why React exploded in popularity - you need to understand how the data is supposed to flow using its system.
Let't take a look at our Tweet component again:

We have a function called `createLike` and it updates the state of the component. When the state of the component updates, the component's display refreshes.

The components display is a group of smaller components with properties. One component has a property where we're passing in our `createLike` function as a property. 
So what happens if we use `createLike` inside of that component? Well, then both the `TweetContent` and `TweetCommands` components will update, because it updated appropriately inside of `Tweet` and it refreshed the display with new properties and state.

At first glance, it kinda seems like you're running in circles, but one of the reasons that React exploded in popularity was because of this contained one-way data flow.
This ended up creating a lot of intuition between idea, planning and coding, because it was really easy to design and distribute objects that worked well together.
As a result, people were able to create a lot of interesting architectures and controls over user experiences with these display containers and data pipelines.

To put it simply, like a Tweet, think about your typical tiktok video and the relationships that describe it as a series of messages. A video contains a like button, a comment section and a share button. A comment section contains comments. A comment contains a reply button. The list goes on and on in a number of ways. This is how Robots Building Education looks like:

Phew, that was pretty tough. So we covered react components and more or less saw things in action. In summary, React is a data model that creates components with state and properties and displays visual elements with it.

So now let's take a look at these elements. Let's start with HTML.


# HTML

So some of you folks may recall this from the Myspace days. For those of you that aren't familiar, Myspace was a popular social networking site in the 2000s. Facebook quickly became the titan of the industry shortly after, but during those days a lot of people were able to customize their profile page. It was a lot of people's first experience with programming and many people enjoyed it. Well, that whole thing became an industry, and it's mostly lead by big tech organizations and their influence over how software is developed.

So, actually, that's why I tell people to learn React before HTML/CSS/Javascript. It's just the right economic thing to do if you understood who changes the software. React is ultimately an upgrade of the previous system and there's very little logical conclusion to do things inefficiently because any future upgrade now will be built off the influence of what React and Facebook accomplished. Let's put it this way, these days, you're probably going to learn some basics of photography on an iPhone first, and every year that passes it becomes more true.

You can learn them all at the same time, and truthfully, most engineers are not educators. They certainly are opinionated though, but that comes with the trade.

Anyway, the name of the game with HTML is just how you're structuring your display. I recommend to think about organizing things into containers and then placing the containers where they need to be.
