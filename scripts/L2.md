# Lesson 2 - The Frontend

GPT-4L Event Driven Programming


## Intro

Okay let's quickly review lesson one,
We took at look at the fundamentals of organizing data with code.
We learned about objects, functions, loops and logic.

One of the examples we saw there was a version of a class that we call a component. 
Components are a popular way to create user interface and experiences.
Some of you may have recognized this code as something similar to what you used to see on Myspace.

```jsx
let Tweet = ({ tweet }) => {
  let [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)


  let createLike = () => {     
     setLiked(true)
  }
 
  return(
    <section>

      <img src={tweet.user.photo_id} />
      
      <bold>{tweet.user.name}</bold>
      <icon>{tweet.user.isVerified}</icon>
      <label>{tweet.user.handle}</label>
      <label>{tweet.user.age_of_tweet}</label>
       
      <section>{tweet.text}</section>
      
      <label>{tweet.total_comments}</label>
      <label>{tweet.total_retweets}</label>
      
      <label onClick={createLike}>
        {tweet.total_likes}
      </label>

    </section>
  )
 }

```

There's a long history why, but in a nutshell, Meta and Google have a lot of influence over how the internet is built
and they basically created an entire industry around that skill. So I guess you can say the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.

I used to find a lot of trouble back in the day when I would 
suggest to people that they're better off just learning a skill like React 
instead the traditional HTML/CSS/Javascript but that claim mostly comes from a place of wisdom rather than tradition.

So before explaining React, let's just create a simple model. Our phones are these remote controls for the digital world.
When we use these apps, we change the state of our experiences in the digital world. That's pretty true right?

So when you think about those elements in an app, and the way that you interact with them, you create these reactions where state of the user interface or experience has changed.
That's React programming. 

These are the main parts of a react component:

1. You have the component's hooks
2. You have the component's state
3. You have the component's properties

As always, let's keep things simple. Hooks are functions that handles and updates the state of a component. I like to think about them like levers, 
where using the levers will result in the machine changing. But if you look at our digital remote example from earlier, using hooks would be the button pressing event of the remote.


Next is the state. The state is essentially the dynamic data that you're managing. It's the data that you expect to change because either machines or people are using it.
In short, when you change the state of the component, you're refreshing the display of it and causing the component to render again.

Now here's where I rewind back to our conversation about learning React before HTML/CSS/Javascript. I don't believe there's anything wrong with doing it the traditional way,
but I really think it's worth observing **why** React, or other component-based programming frameworks ended up completely dominating and uplifting the field. They're really 
wonderful pieces of technology under the hood and I would encourage you all to study the programming languages internals and history along the way.

Well, I guess this might just be me getting older and appreciating the little details of things, 
but isn't it kind of cool that programming languages translate things like `["hello", world"] translate to `new Array()`?
or, in React's case, `<header>Hello World</header>`, it translates to `React.createElement("header", null, "Hello World")

Anway, let's stay on task. Now the last part of a component we really need to understand are the properties of the component. Let's change our tweet component.

```

// we have the tweet property. We don't change it.
let Tweet = ({ tweet }) => {

  // state, defined by a useState hook
  let [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)


  // event that changes and updates states
  let createLike = () => {     
     setLiked(true)
  }
 
 
 // the component render/display
  return(
    <section>

      <img src={tweet.user.photo_id} />
      
      <bold>{tweet.user.name}</bold>
      <icon>{tweet.user.isVerified}</icon>
      <label>{tweet.user.handle}</label>
      <label>{tweet.user.age_of_tweet}</label>
       
      <section>{tweet.text}</section>
      
      <label>{tweet.total_comments}</label>
      <label>{tweet.total_retweets}</label>
      
      <label onClick={createLike}>
        {tweet.total_likes}
      </label>

    </section>
  )
 }


```
