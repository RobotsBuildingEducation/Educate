Download & install VSCode. This is where you write code.
Download & install nodeJS. This lets you build write apps.

Open your command line terminal and install npm. We’re using a special command here called “sudo” which gives you administrator level permissions on your device, since I don’t know how your device is configured

`sudo npm install -g npm`

Create a folder and name it after your project. Im calling my app The Digital Border.

Open VSCode and open your folder in the app the same way you open up documents on google drive or microsoft word.

Find the little icons on the bottom left of your window to open up the the menu that contains your command line

Select the terminal

Now run a command to start a react project with Vite. Remember what we said about letting the machines do the work for you? Use command `npm create vite@latest` and answer the questions. The following folder shows you how I configured the project using a React setup with javascript. They're even nice enough to tell you what to do next!

So let's do what they're telling us. `cd` stands for `change directory` which is pretty much like clicking into a folder.

If you click the "package.json" file in your app folder, you'll see the list of software being installed for your project under the dependencies keys. This is what `sudo npm install` is going to do when you run it in your project. 

<img width="672" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/66df9839-86a6-4789-a42a-e918f411a6e8">


Alright, now let's run your app! Run `npm run dev` and your app will launch in development mode! Congratulations! You can find more application commands that we'll use later under scripts when you view the `package.json` file.

Now let's set up our database with Google Cloud. Run this command to install firebase onto your machine: `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`

<img width="537" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/effebf17-c251-44fc-af8b-f46e313f9b5e">


Now let's initiate and set up the project with the command `firebase login`. You'll end up on your typical google login screen to authenticate your account

<img width="797" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/5b608605-441e-41e0-8183-cd9d1d18cb1a">


Now go to `console.firebase.google.com` and add your project. This will create your dashboard where you can use various backend services like authentication or even out-of-the-box machine learning tools.

<img width="845" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/782947e3-2b65-4ab5-a7c2-1714bbf9d1c1">

When you're in, activate the following services: authentication, firestore and hosting. I'm purposefully not telling you how to because I want you to explore this process with curiosity and I want you to trust your gut! 
<img width="1512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/fe07bc78-32e7-41a3-b81a-7be09a122f66">

Once you've completed it, you'll find access to your website in the Hosting tab. In my case, it's `https://the-digital-border.web.app/`. Now we need to connect our code to this backend service.

Next run `firebase init` and answer the following questions. I selectected `Hosting` and `Firestore`, basically this lets you launch a website and database.
