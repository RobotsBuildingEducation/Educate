Download & install VSCode. This is where you write code.
Download & install nodeJS. This lets you build write apps.

---

Open your command line terminal and install npm. We’re using a special command here called “sudo” which gives you administrator level permissions on your device, since I don’t know how your device is configured

`sudo npm install -g npm`

Create a folder and name it after your project. Im calling my app The Digital Border.


<img width="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/539b1c8c-deab-4edf-8a60-1188b266e41f">



Open VSCode and open your folder in the app the same way you open up documents on google drive or microsoft word.

Find the little icons on the bottom left of your window to open up the the menu that contains your command line



<img width="302" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/196f950d-1e48-4203-88f7-47106c12b3f1">


Select the terminal
<img width="972" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/71b3dfb5-1d30-4f47-85a5-10054d161d9e">

Now run a command to start a react project with Vite. Remember what we said about letting the machines do the work for you? Use command `npm create vite@latest` and answer the questions. The following folder shows you how I configured the project using a React setup with javascript. They're even nice enough to tell you what to do next!

<img width="969" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/d72015b7-1438-45c8-860b-bcc3fd0fba33">


So let's do what they're telling us. `cd` stands for `change directory` which is pretty much like clicking into a folder.
<img width="667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/7f2345a5-b219-48fd-8b84-d463ba471d07">



If you click the "package.json" file in your app folder, you'll see the list of software being installed for your project under the dependencies keys. This is what `sudo npm install` is going to do when you run it in your project. 

<img width="672" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/66df9839-86a6-4789-a42a-e918f411a6e8">


Alright, now let's run your app! Run `npm run build` and then run `npm run dev` and your app will launch in development mode! Congratulations! You can find more application commands that we'll use later under scripts when you view the `package.json` file.

<img width="653" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/3b99e3d0-fcd0-46a1-bcb8-fd94fd96323b">

<img width="1512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/dbec6b33-f0a5-4aef-a2de-0300cce75aed">


Now let's set up our database with Google Cloud. Run this command to install firebase onto your machine: `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`

<img width="537" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/effebf17-c251-44fc-af8b-f46e313f9b5e">


Now let's initiate and set up the project with the command `firebase login`. You'll end up on your typical google login screen to authenticate your account

<img width="797" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/5b608605-441e-41e0-8183-cd9d1d18cb1a">


Now go to `console.firebase.google.com` and add your project. This will create your dashboard where you can use various backend services like authentication or even out-of-the-box machine learning tools.

<img width="845" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/782947e3-2b65-4ab5-a7c2-1714bbf9d1c1">

When you're in, activate the following services: authentication, firestore and hosting. I'm purposefully not telling you how to because I want you to explore this process with curiosity and I want you to trust your gut! 
<img width="1512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/fe07bc78-32e7-41a3-b81a-7be09a122f66">

Once you've completed it, you'll find access to your website in the Hosting tab. In my case, it's `https://the-digital-border.web.app/`. Now we need to connect our code to this backend service.

<img width="1066" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/a64532b6-bd65-48fe-96ac-631687bb7708">



Next run `firebase init` and answer the following questions. These questions will write files into your project that connect your code to your firebase project.

In a nutshell, here are the steps:

1. Activate firestore and hosting.
<img width="602" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/f39406ab-7a19-4284-bc97-8fae797b58a6">

2. Select "use an existing product" and select the project you recently created.
   <img width="558" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/fa31a2d7-216d-471e-9917-9011f10428b2">

3. Press enter and allow firebase to create a file for rules to secure your data
<img width="438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/f29566c6-7fb0-4f09-b6ef-1c7614fab936">


4. Press enter and allow firebase to create a file for indexes
<img width="502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/81c9f504-0d6f-466d-8d1e-9068cafc9985">

5. Then setup the following answers to configure your application and connect it to the web

<img width="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/a91acd2e-9ddf-45d3-b1ac-eef8c5363cd8">

6. Now early you had run `npm run build`. This essentially prepared your code for deployment. Run `firebase deploy` and you will launch your website!

Pretty cool right! Congrats!

Now let's create users. We need to install firebase and a react library that will make it easier for us to implement a login button. Run this command ` sudo npm install --save firebase react-firebaseui --legacy-peer-deps`. The legacy-peer-deps dependency will give you a stable version in the event that these libraries aren't up to date.

<img width="683" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/25780912-900c-40d5-a766-3eb793bd2fa3">


Next we have to activate authentication in our firebase dashboard, select sign-in methods, Google, and enable it.
<img width="1254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/13cda1ab-b5c1-4faf-a57b-ce92766c7366">


After that, we have to get data about your project to connect everything together once and for all. So go to your project settings
<img width="426" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/14f3d387-c7dd-4b5c-8282-918d1b5fd11f">


Select the web application denoted by the `</>` bracket symbol
<img width="979" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/fc92505d-6d16-432d-a287-2cf6beb46d13">

Register your app's name and you will get a set of keys. This is what will connect your backend to your code so you can customize your product.
You can find these keys in your project settings again and you can use this to connect to other devices if you build on mobile or visual studios like Unity 
<img width="987" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/887051df-605f-4b35-8c6f-6e86617e29f1">




# The Frontend


Now let's go back to your code. Let's create a folder called `database` inside your `app/src` folder and create a file called `firebaseResources.js`


<img width="564" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/21b242a6-d48b-4f1e-a1e9-3cdf6bc3afe2">


In our App.jsx file, we'll import a sign in button component from the library we installed and insert the component
<img width="585" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/b5425002-e862-4bf8-9812-40e77bfea5ac">







Now your app will have a login button that you can log into!
<img width="808" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/3f0d1cae-5fc6-4e88-aace-012333944780">

If we go into our authentication service, we can see that we've created a user
<img width="1370" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/46b473cb-f49e-42ac-bc62-54312db1de12">

Now we can continue to engage in this user construct so that we can create user experiences by defining what belong's in a user's profile. Lets import some things from functionality from firebase:

<img width="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/3fa64e01-47d4-4868-af28-d80ae91713f4">


Then let's define the state we're going to see on the screen:
<img width="458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/f9051cfe-6e5f-4344-8f42-3ce39a4039d5">

After that we're going to use a common hook called `useEffect`. This hook allows us to prepare components and react to the different changes that occur in a component's usage.

<img width="560" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/f655084b-cfb5-475e-90a2-9649e03d9272">


Let's define a header component to prepare the display based on the state of the user being logged in or not:

<img width="524" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/be15b738-2bda-420f-9595-dcc586f8ef72">


Then we simply insert the header variable into the rendering process

<img width="525" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/ddfdcd70-7393-4c2c-b53e-5d89aff18aab">




Amazing. You now have a real, live app that you can design and build in your vision. Run `npm run build` then `firebase deploy` again to refresh your website with the new code!
<img width="781" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/23c078da-6e44-4e40-bff5-e828576671fe">



# Summary

Let's take a deep breath and summarize what we did here. We used the command line to set up our application with react and firebase.
Then we configured our code using identities and keys to define our systems so that they can communicate and move data around.
This allowed us to create users and design user experiences.

So that's the nature of building applications. The frontend is going to handle user experiences, visual elements and events. The backend is going to design pipelines to communicate, design and move data across networks.

Now for the last part - working with other engineers.

# Github

Github is where we can collaborate with other engineers. Think of it like Google Drive but with extra steps so that code can update safely and predictably.
We're not going to go through a tutorial in this lesson because this is a worthwhile challenge for you to figure out on your own.
It will test your knowledge when it comes to connecting services and working with your operating system.
Think of it like your first real test - you have some knowledge, but not all, and you need to figure the rest out.

When you figure it out, you'll be able to onboard yourself to Robots Building Education. In the future, you can expect shorter videos
that jump right into building applications with ChatGPT or Fintech - because after this I can at least assume that you're aware
of the moving parts and can more or less figure things out yourself as I go through the lectures.

So let's highlight some of the things you can expect to use regularly, your bread and butter commands:

`git clone`
