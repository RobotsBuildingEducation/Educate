Download & install VSCode. This is where you write code.
Download & install nodeJS. This lets you build write apps.

Open your command line terminal and install npm. We’re using a special command here called “sudo” which gives you administrator level permissions on your device, since I don’t know how your device is configured

`sudo npm install -g npm`

Create a folder and name it after your project. Im calling my app The Digital Border.

Open VSCode and open your folder in the app the same way you open up documents on google drive or microsoft word.

Find the little icons on the bottom left of your window to open up the the menu that contains your command line

Select the terminal

Now run a command to start a react project with Vite. Remember what we said about letting the machines do the work for you? Use command `npm create vite@latest` and answer the questions. The following folder shows you how I configured the project using a React setup with javascript. They're even nice enough to tell you what to do next!

So let's do what they're telling us. `cd` stands for `change directory` which is pretty much like clicking into a folder.

If you click the "package.json" file in your app folder, you'll see the list of software being installed for your project under the dependencies keys. This is what `sudo npm install` is going to do when you run it in your project.

Alright, now let's run your app! Run `npm run dev` and your app will launch in development mode! Congratulations! You can find more application commands that we'll use later under scripts when you view the `package.json` file.
