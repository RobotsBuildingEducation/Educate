## Intro

Hey. Welcome to Robots Building Education.
You probably have a ton of questions that you want to address before getting started, so let's address them!
Before getting started getting started... yes, we use ChatGPT and AI here. 
We call her Roxana and we're going to teach you how to build these cool chat apps.

So I know some of you are probably a little scared or intimidated. First, shoulders down, deep breath. Let's chill and think about the metaphysical first. 
You might be wondering if you're smart enough or if you need to be good at math in order to learn this.
I'm here to tell you that it's fine to feel that way, and if you could believe it, I also feel that way a little bit right now.

That's because I need to inspire confidence in a lot of people, and one good way is by giving people a great deal.
My deal here is that I think I can teach you how to code and build businesses in like 30 minutes.


And honestly, part of me is kind of nervous about doing that, but that's really no different than what you're feeling.
It's a kind of imposter syndrome. But an easy way to deal with that is to ground yourself and to remember that that 
only happens because you want to hold yourself to a higher standard. That feeling is a signal that you're looking at a challenge.
You want to move fast when you're not completely prepared. So let's get you prepared. How are we gonna do that?


Well, first, f you go on my app robotsbuildingeducation.com, you'll find a list of frequently asked questions, things like,
- "Is programming hard"
- "what computer do I need?"
- "am I too old?"
- "what kind of jobs can I do"
- "Is bootcamp worth it?"

But for now, let's do a speed run.
- "Is programming hard"
  - no
- "what computer do I need?"
  - no
- "am I too old?"
  - no
- "what kind of jobs can I do"
  - no
- "Is bootcamp worth it?"
  - no


But other than that, this is how we'll do it:
First, we're going to imagine and illustrate.
Second, we're going to draw connections and relationships.
Third, we're going to observe the new information.
Last, we're going to practice with it.

So that's the key. It's not hard. It is a challenge. But sometimes challenges can be made easier with the right help.
So that's where I come in, really. I'll tell you often that I teach more than just coding, but I'm really only 
here to have you experience the sensation of learning. It's a very powerful and influential sensation.

I want you to feel that so that you remember that you're capable of learning anything that you want to, 
it's just that everyone has their own reasons. So all that coding, the content, the stocks, that's just like colors in a painting.
You're here to learn and create impact out of it. 

The cool thing about computer science is that it's the science of computation, which means it's the science of solving problems. 
So you can do anything with it. You can apply it to climate technology, psychology, cancer research, art, sports, anything. 
Technology has a place where information exists! So my goal is to remind you of that. You can be that person. 
We are all that person - we all just have different reasons. I think coding, creating and dealing are good subjects to help you 
along your way because it touches on subjects of using your mind to engineer, communicate and negotiate with reality.


And that's all. I encourage you to take some time to internalize this lesson. It's a good thing to take time with. 
Allow yourself be that person and find the courage to continue to walk in that direction. One day, if not already, 
you'll find the strength to turn the unknown into your home.
