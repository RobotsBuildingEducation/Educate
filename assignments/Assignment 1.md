# Resume Assignment 1

#### Assignment ethos
let's consider a few things to define our work culture. You're treated as a software engineer. So view yourself as one and don't deny yourself of that even if you're a student or self-teaching. So some things will be demanded of you but we also want to create a safe environment. So if you think a question is stupid - please ask it. Those are by far the most important questions. I don't care if you say "What should I Google?". That's an amazing question. 

Feel free to ask questions, ask for resources, or use Google/Youtube and other places to help you grow your knowledge. Nothing here is beyond your capacity to learn, understand and build. Assignments persist over time. Engage with them to see the progress of this application. Contribute to them, even if they're already answered, to gain experience or expand knowledge. You are encouraged to attempt, fail and grow here. As always, if it feels like you're not good enough, then you're definitely in the right place and need to keep moving forward.

#### Assignment
1. As you can see, the project is empty. There's are some random things we need to do to setup our project for personal and team use. Feel free to explore or suggest those things in a pull request. Report back what you think. That will count as valid work.

2. How are we going to initialize our React application? Will we use something like `create-react-app`? Why or why not? Should we use an entire product like Hydrogen by Shopify? What are the tradeoffs of our choices? There is no wrong answer here. Only justifications for what you believe as an engineer.


#### What you need to accomplish this task

[Example of a pull request and branch](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/pull/2)
