**Working With Other Engineers Summary**
<p>
Github is an app where you can collaborate with other engineers. 
Git allows you to interact with services like Github. 
You will need to learn a few key processes: 
branches & commits - creating copies of codebases so that you can isolate your changes from other people 
pushing and pulling - the process of updating a branch or receiving updates from a branch 
pull requests and merging - the process of reviewing code updates and comparing it to the version thats being changed, then integrating those changes 
merge conflicts - when codebases work in the same code files and things change in an unsynchronized way, resulting in people having to review changes manually and determine which version should be used. 

There are more advanced ways to manage this process using automation and workflow triggers called CI/CD or continuous integration and deployment. With that, you can help me work on #robotsbuildingeducation and get experience for your resume.
