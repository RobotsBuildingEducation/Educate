## Level 1: Introduction To Coding
<img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/201819462-6a76b68f-7fe8-4804-9e58-2fab353f3071.png" width="100%" />

[Lesson 1 - Foundation of Coding & Logic](https://www.tiktok.com/@robotsbuildingeducation/video/7166910359456976170?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7142667285525055019)
- Code is the organization and processing of
information. You can design and organize
anything logically with data. Your shirt. Your
sink. Your thoughts. It's not math.
You use a combination of types of data to
organize. Numbers, letters, lists, true/false
values, unavailable values.


[Lesson 2 - Foundations of Data](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQxtWVn/)
- So you have a bunch of data types and you can do
things with it. For example, if you have a set of
something, you can count through that set and run
some kind of process on it.

It's not that hard. You have a hand (data) and a set of
fingers you can count (process) through. You have a
sink and that sink has a collection of dishes that can be
cleaned. Music, followers, transactions.

Data creates logic. E.g is there a plate? Is it dirty?
Groups of data creates functionality. Can I clean those
plates? You can repeatedly do this down to the atomic
or universal scope.

[Lesson 3 - Creating Objects**](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQe8jC3/)
- You can create custom data by
creating "objects". A class defines how
an object can be used. Typically, you're
creating, getting, updating, and
deleting data. You can practice this by
modeling the real world.
For example:
CashApp.get Transactions0
Instagram.blockUser0
Twitter.update Tweetl
Gmail.delete EmailO
Here's an interesting question. When
you block a user, do you create a
a blocked user or are you updatingsomething?

[Lesson 4 - Network Functions**](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQJ34Ua/)
- You're able to run those get, create, update and delete processes
data from other networks. This is how you build apps connected
to the web. So when you type in google.com, you're fetching data
from some other location and that process takes time. The same
is true for sending messages to people. There is always delay.
This is due to physics of the network. You don't know how long
it can take, so you have to create some kind of loading or visual
process for a use.

[Lesson 5 - Loops & Counting**](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQe18WL/)
- We go through counting basics again since
counting is extremely important when you're
coding and solving algorithms. In this lesson,
we simply break down how to logically think
"for each item in a set, do this thing" when
you're creating algorithms.

## Level 2: Building An App
<img width="100%" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/201819647-44796274-aa67-442e-bc1c-f7f8f60cea45.png">

[Lesson 1 - HTML](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQJvWfk/)
- HTML is language that helps you
structure views. We pay attention to the
fact that HTML elements can structure
things and these structures have attributes
that are useful for users like, what happens
if I click something?

[Lesson 2 - CSS](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQJo5Xo/)
- CSS how things look. They are attributes
given to HTML elements. We quickly
talk about the basics of positioning,
wrapping and animating things.

[Lesson 3 - React](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQe8srF/)
- Six figure skill. Like creating objects, react uses these
things called components. They manage the state of
data the same way. Think of "state and hooks" in react
as levers that manage data, and when you use those
levers, the visuals refresh.
For example, if I like a TikTok video, how many screens
and visuals have to update around the world to handle
the update?

[Lesson 4 - How Users Are Born](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQee5s1/)
- So to create an app system, you need to create users. But what are
users under the hood? You're generally dealing with security keys
that are used to identify you as a user. Think about a set of
apartment keys or using a security card to enter a building. That's
what's typically happening under the hood to connect my
Instagram to yours when we log in and update this experience.


[Lesson 5 - Managing Databases](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQeFJRC/)
- Databases are kind of like react, but instead of using code to
organize visuals, you're using code to store and manage data
that users care about and needs. There are many ways to do
this, but the fundamental here is that you typically define
groups of data by unique IDs and create relationships
between those IDs to create experiences with data. You
need unique IDs like aw18162ajsg62Gwxn00997 because
you're dealing with SO much data that unique keys allow
you to reliably not replicate that data.


[Lesson 6 - What's Backend And The Cloud?](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQeYkFx/)
- Think of a restaurant. You have a
customer, cook and waiter. The waiter
manages the messaging and
communications. Sometimes there is no
waiter, and that creates a different system.
So the backend creates and manages the
communication pipelines. These messages
can inform users, machine learning
algorithms or other networks.


[Lesson 7 - Operating Systems And Machines](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQeMkJR/)
- You will often need to directly talk to your computer or
other networks. You already do this using GUIs (graphic
user interfaces) when you use apps, like opening IG. You
can do this with commands too. So instead of "click
install" you write "instagram install". A combination of
both interfaces is actually something like those intelligent
chatbots or Google search which is kind of interesting tbh


[Lesson 8 - Setting Up An App](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQJ7UQQ/)
- We start to use what we learned to create
a project where we will write code and
build an app. You will need to learn how to
install Node, PM and Visual Studio


[Lesson 9 - Connecting App To A Financial Technology Service](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQJwj4X/)
- We use what we recently learned to
connect to a network that allows us
to create financial technology
companies or products.


[Lesson 10 - Connecting App To A Database](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRQJwPuo/)
- With all of that, we can use a cloud
database to start defining users, storing
data and creating real experiences.


[Lesson 11 - Working With Other Engineers - Featuring Chat GPT](https://www.tiktok.com/@robotsbuildingeducation/video/7178398406371593518?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7142667285525055019)

<p>
Github is an app where you can collaborate with other engineers. 
Git allows you to interact with services like Github. 
You will need to learn a few key processes: 
branches & commits - creating copies of codebases so that you can isolate your changes from other people 
pushing and pulling - the process of updating a branch or receiving updates from a branch 
pull requests and merging - the process of reviewing code updates and comparing it to the version thats being changed, then integrating those changes 
merge conflicts - when codebases work in the same code files and things change in an unsynchronized way, resulting in people having to review changes manually and determine which version should be used. 

There are more advanced ways to manage this process using automation and workflow triggers called CI/CD or continuous integration and deployment. With that, you can help me work on #robotsbuildingeducation and get experience for your resume.
