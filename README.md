<pre>All content and offerings will be free. Payment is optional. 
All app subscriptions and Patreon contributions earned will go to the scholarship fund.
It will directly support Latino engineers, artists, entrepeneurs and future leaders. 
The essence of Robots Building Education: embed the creation of scholarships in the process of learning.

## Learn To Code
The goal of the introductions is to believe that you are capable of doing it. I explain more in the mentorship section.
Before starting. Please watched the 3 pinned videos on my profile on Tiktok. It covers all of the lessons I teach you but applies them so that we can build a real app. It's only about 5-7 minutes. Ideally, you'll be like `"woah, that wasn't so bad..."`

#### Tiktok 


1. I'm curating a playlist on Tiktok that will introduce to you what you need to learn and how to think about it in order to break into tech or to build your own apps and businesses. It's about 30-40 minutes. I will continuously improve it until people can learn how to code by just listening to my voice. The reason it has to be like this is because many Latinos and minorities work in labor, and they may only have access to a headphone during the part of the day where they have most energy (I used to work in labor)

#### Youtube
2. If you don't have access to the Tiktok playlist, I'll be creating backup Youtube videos. These videos will be compilations. Over the long term, I will make these videos specific to Youtube so that the presentation is better for long-form learning

#### Afterwards
3. I recommend practicing these ideas and reinforcing them on course platforms like Codecademy and Fireship. Fireship is a high quality course creator on Youtube and Codecademy is an OG learn to code platform where I started in 2014. They both offer free and paid services. I recommend paying for the service ($20-$40/month) as an investment for 1-2 months. I don't have any affiliate links here so the only way to directly support me is via Patreon.

#### Ultra long-term
I will be building an app where your subscription will create scholarships. It will be cheaper than Fireship and Codecademy, and ideally more focused/better like the Tiktok videos.

#### Ultra super-long-term
I want to change the nature of social media to challenge school credentials and online certificates.


## Gaining Experience
This github repository is one of five projects building software. Some are much more long term. I call it RO.B.E E.L.E.C.T or
Robots Building Education:
E - Educate: a platform for teachers 
L - Learn: a platform for learning
E - Empower: a platform for decentralized learning protocols 
C - Communicate: a platform to youth and professional networking
T - Testify: a platform for youth experience

I'm choosing **Educate** as the project to assist others to gain experience. I've built a demo version of it many years here: [Appletree.io](https://appletree.io). It's an application where teachers can share resources and collaborate together, much like Github. The assignment/tasks are meant to be challenging and they're designed for real-world skills learning, but they can be figured out by a beginner that has learned the previous material. It will require you to understand Github, which I have not made introductory tutorials on yet. If you are seeking real-world experience or project experience for your resume, please work on these while I work on "Learn" by myself. I will be happy to be a point of contact/reference on your job applications and can confirm your work to employers.

Long term, I hope to have a stronger pipeline with industry recruiters. I'm working on that.

The first assignment is here: [ASSIGNMENT 1](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/blob/main/assignments/Assignment%201.md)

_TL;DR_ The goal of the assignment is to get the project started using a React toolchain like. The key is explaining why one was selected over another. `create-react-app`, `next.js` or `hydrogen by Shopify`

## Mentorship
<img width="1127" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/201515867-2a01a60a-9ac1-452c-843a-70a6f0d4bb80.png">

I will read every email.

At this point, you might realize that what I work on isn't just technology. It's Latino culture. Technology is just an intersection. It taps into our cultural desire and story to pursue opportunity through education. It's a cultural application. So we're going to tap into many subjects ranging from mentorship, well-being and the challenges we face as Latinos. Currently, I'm working on getting the right message when it comes to mental well-being and our history with white supremacy and colonization. I think when you really take time to think about history, your feelings and why things became the way they are, you'll experience something humbling that's important for a well-lived life. 

Well frankly, from my view, I think getting that message down right is a work in progress. I hope to have the message close enough to perfect in order to deliver it to scholarships. It should be empowering.

Feel free to connect with me personally on robotsbuildingeducation@gmail.com. Feel free to share your story. And you might as well apply the scholarship with it :)

Please take the take the time to read some of these essays. It's a work in progress and its sometimes mentioned on instagram:

## Building Scholarships

- To apply to the scholarship: email robotsbuildingeducation@gmail.com with your story and vision. That's all. You will forever be eligible to receive $1,000 in Bitcoin, Apple or Meta credits. I will personally read and issue scholarships.

To support and help create this scholarship, I ask that people subscribe to my Patreon. In the future, I/we will build apps that will support this effort. It's only $1, $3, $8. Please support it, it keeps me going and gets me closer to a ridiculous vision of mine.

For the most part, this effort is only driven by me. There isn't anyone else working on it. It can slow progress sometimes, but I work hard as hell for this idea, and the longer I can do it alone, the less I/we have to ever depend on the needs of investors and their capitalistic driven needs. My efforts aren't meant for profit. I want our community to succeed. That's it.
