<b>All content and offerings will be free. Payment is optional. 
All app subscriptions and Patreon contributions earned will go to the scholarship fund.
It will directly support Latino engineers, artists, entrepeneurs and future leaders. 
The essence of Robots Building Education: embed the creation of scholarships in the process of 
learning. I want to flood the barrio and border with silicon before we flood it with ice.

## Learn To Code
<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/201549376-259ac430-a2df-4ab7-bb0c-346b67f90165.png">

The goal of the introductions is to believe that you are capable of doing it. I explain more in the mentorship section.
Before starting. Please watched the 3 pinned videos on my profile on Tiktok. It covers all of the lessons I teach you but applies them so that we can build a real app. It's only about 5-7 minutes. Ideally, you'll be like `"woah, that wasn't so bad..."`

#### Tiktok 


1. I'm curating a playlist on Tiktok that will introduce to you what you need to learn and how to think about it in order to break into tech or to build your own apps and businesses. It's about 30-40 minutes. I will continuously improve it until people can learn how to code by just listening to my voice. The reason it has to be like this is because many Latinos and minorities work in labor with headphones, they're busy parents with high amounts of unpaid labor or they have some significant challenge that prevents them from being able to access learning.

#### TikTok Desktop
2. If you don't have access to the Tiktok playlist, I've recreated the playlist here so that you can watch it on desktop instead
[Desktop Version](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/blob/main/Tiktok/Learn%20To%20Code.md)

#### Afterwards
3. I recommend practicing these ideas and reinforcing them on course platforms like Codecademy and Fireship. Fireship is a high quality course creator on Youtube and Codecademy is an OG learn to code platform where I started in 2014. They both offer free and paid services. I recommend paying for the service ($20-$40/month) as an investment for 1-2 months. I don't have any affiliate links here so the only way to directly support me is via Patreon.

#### Ultra long-term
I will be building an app where your subscription will create scholarships. It will be cheaper than Fireship and Codecademy, and ideally more focused/better like the Tiktok videos.

#### Ultra super-long-term
I want to change the nature of social media to challenge school credentials and online certificates.


## Gaining Experience
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/201503616-1c8ba6f4-3697-44d9-be7f-ecd227a3f087.png)

This github repository is one of five projects building software. Some are much more long term. I call it RO.B.E E.L.E.C.T or
Robots Building Education:
E - Educate: a platform for teachers 
L - Learn: a platform for learning
E - Empower: a platform for decentralized learning protocols 
C - Communicate: a platform to youth and professional networking
T - Testify: a platform for youth experience

I'm choosing **Educate** as the project to assist others to gain experience. I've built a demo version of it many years here: [Appletree.io](https://appletree.io). It's an application where teachers can share resources and collaborate together, much like Github. The assignment/tasks are meant to be challenging and they're designed for real-world skills learning, but they can be figured out by a beginner that has learned the previous material. It will require you to understand Github, which I have not made introductory tutorials on yet. If you are seeking real-world experience or project experience for your resume, please work on these while I work on "Learn" by myself. I will be happy to be a point of contact/reference on your job applications and can confirm your work to employers.

Long term, I hope to have a stronger pipeline with industry recruiters. I'm working on that.

The first assignment is here: [ASSIGNMENT 1](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/blob/main/assignments/Assignment%201.md)

_TL;DR_ The goal of the assignment is to get the project started using a React toolchain like. The key is explaining why one was selected over another. `create-react-app`, `next.js` or `hydrogen by Shopify`




## Mentorship
<img width="1127" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/201515867-2a01a60a-9ac1-452c-843a-70a6f0d4bb80.png">

I will read every email.

At this point, you might realize that what I work on isn't just technology. It's Latino culture. Technology is just an intersection. It taps into our cultural desire and story to pursue opportunity through education. It's a cultural application. So we're going to tap into many subjects ranging from mentorship, well-being and the challenges we face as Latinos. Currently, I'm working on getting the right message when it comes to mental well-being and our history with white supremacy and colonization. I think when you really take time to think about history, your feelings and why things became the way they are, you'll experience something humbling that's important for a well-lived life. 

Well frankly, from my view, I think getting that message down right is a work in progress. I hope to have the message close enough to perfect in order to deliver it to scholarships. It should be empowering.

Feel free to connect with me personally on robotsbuildingeducation@gmail.com. Feel free to share your story. And you might as well apply the scholarship with it :)

Please take the take the time to read some of these essays. It's a work in progress and its sometimes mentioned on instagram:

## Building Scholarships
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1589613611/Screen_Shot_2020-05-16_at_12.19.34_AM_iaa5zw.png" width="50%" />

- [TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCHOLARSHIP FUND](https://patreon.com/robotsbuildingeducation)

- To apply to the scholarship: email robotsbuildingeducation@gmail.com with your story and vision. That's all. You will forever be eligible to receive $1,000 in Bitcoin, Apple or Meta credits. I will personally read and issue scholarships.

To support and help create this scholarship, I ask that people subscribe to my Patreon. In the future, I/we will build apps that will support this effort. It's only $1, $3, $8. Please support it, it keeps me going and gets me closer to a ridiculous vision of mine.

For the most part, this effort is only driven by me. There isn't anyone else working on it. It can slow progress sometimes, but I work hard as hell for this idea, and the longer I can do it alone, the less I/we have to ever depend on the needs of investors and their capitalistic driven needs. My efforts aren't meant for profit. I want our community to succeed. That's it.

## FAQ
1. _What coding bootcamp or certification should I get to break into tech?_

This depends on your situation. I think its helpful to reconsider all of your options after understanding why people choose different pathways of studying and what you ought to do in any situation. You need to be the CEO of you. Your primary goal should be to expand your network. You have to assume that learning your qualified skills is a given, so it's not much of a competitive edge even if skills are in demand.

Bootcamps have varying levels of success and they're expensive for-profit schools. People go to them because of the promise of employment. But what happens in a tech recession with hiring freezes and layoffs? They have their benefits and consequences. Community colleges are also challenging - the employment network may not be there based on the reputation of the school. Credits may not transfer. Self-teaching becomes a question of having no start or finish line. So what do you do?

Remember, you're the CEO of you. So either path you pick. Whether you decide to go to Harvard or you decide to teach yourself for free on Youtube, you're going to have to acquire education, build your network, build projects and find experience to compete safely against other people. I recommend bootcamps and certifications if you're a parent or someone who can absolutely not afford the time to study at a college or university.

I recommend a college or university study. I also encourage you to learn how to code. You don't have to pursue computer science. You can study business, or psychology, or biology. It doesn't matter. Coding and computer science just integrates and enhances with everything.


2. _What got you started?_

I was studying business at UIC and eventually had to retake some math courses. I found it kind of frustrating given that I had studied Pre-calculus honors and skipped Calculus in high school for statistics. My counselor could not support my interest to study statistics and did not inform me about computer science and machine learning. I considered computer science, but was overwhelmed by the amount of math I needed to catch up on and do.

At 19 I dropped out. It was a bender. I started working in a factory and my appreciation for machine and robotics grew as a result. I went back to community college to study mechanical engineering. I was learning some math online and discovered Khan Academy. I was fascinated by the whole institution and who was driving it and took a stronger interest in education technology in particular. This made me switch my journey from mechanical engineering to computer science.

I went on to study computer science with the intention of developing education technology, inspired by Khan Academy. A lot of it was reinforced since I transferred to a "teacher's" university and was much more involved in sociological studies. My study of computer science matured into an interest in human-computer interaction or more commonly known as UI/UX (user interfaces and user experiences).

So I started to work on Robots Building Education some time between 2014 and 2015 in community college and made it an expression of my own education. You can see an early version of it here: https://triton-cis-190.org/zepeda/desktop/index.html

As you can see, not much has actually changed in the past 7-8 years. That's kind of intentional. Part of my belief with this idea is that it takes time to understand how to do it correctly.


3. _Which programming language?_

The most popular ones are Javascript and Python because that's what the web is huge by volume. But the answer is it depends on what kind of machines you want to work on. For the most part, most programming languages are similar, so there's a lot of transferrable skills. It's actually a lot like music, where a musician may know multiple tools or instrumentals because their foundations are well studied. From a computer science perspective, programming languages may have some specific nuances that are important based on what you're trying to build - which again goes back to why I suggest you take the time to understand what kind of machines you want to work on.

4. _Income expectaions?_

You can make well over 7+ figures working in tech. However, my general rule of thumb is that you can afford a family on one income. That's a pretty good situation to be in.

5. _Are you Democrat or Republican?_

I'm neither. I'm not even independent. All I give a fuck about is the drug war and doing my part to heal and amend away from that terrible history. 



## Investor Relations

Currently, this is run by one person and it's intentionally done this way. To understand some core philosophy that guides me, I recommend to read the following books:

1. The One World Schoolhouse by Salman Khan (Khan Academy)
2. Teaching Community: A Pedagogy Of Hope (bell hooks)
3. Race After Technology (Rahu Benjamin)

I'm largely inspired by Khan Academy and have been for many years. I think there can be different approaches to contribute to solving the same problem. Khan Academy did an excellent job becoming an adjacent and supportive element to public education and started from the classroom. I'm not doing that. I'm starting at the community. So my concerns are different. I'm not concerned with schedule. I'm not concerned with administrative standards. My concern is the experience of a kid growing up in a barrio and the disenfranchisement that comes with it.

So I care about creating scholarships. I care about making students feel like their learning is significant and important to others. I care about empowering communities through the individuals that exist in it. It's more of a counter-culture in some ways and admittedly it's not easy given how corporatized public and private relationships are.

So given that, right now, I feel like it's important to focus on creating a healthy scholarship fund and engaging with the community that way. The community ought to feel responsible for it, not simply granted it. They worked to create that environment. It belongs to them.

But at the end of the day, here are the significant implementations I would like to work on:

1. Embedding scholarships in digital education 
2. Access to many best fit teachers
3. Expanding social media to acreddit more education (verifiable credentials)

Incubating:
4. Educator's collaborative cloud
5. Financial & civic Engagement


If you're interested in investing in me, then to be totally honest I'm not really sure what the best approach would be. I intentionally try to run with the lowest economy possible although I suppose doing this full-time would be more impactful. I could probably go pretty hard but I never really considered outside influence in the process. I always felt like I just needed to tap into the culture the right way with the right amount of effort to make something happen.


## Things I'm Working On
- Industry recruiter pipeline. Basically there are people whos jobs are to get you a job. I'm going to connect with them more over time to make you guys have a stronger, trust worthy and immediate network. Having a larger following on Tiktok with my Latino empowerment brand is helpful. It may be a long-term thing with project Community in E.L.E.C.T 

- Improving Learnability of this project from discovery on TikTok.

- Revising old videos 

- Stock market writings
