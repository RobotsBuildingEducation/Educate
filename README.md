# Resume Assignment 1

#### Assignment ethos
let's consider a few things to define our work culture. You're treated as a software engineer. So view yourself as one and don't deny yourself of that even if you're a student or self-teaching. So some things will be demanded of you but we also want to create a safe environment. So if you think a question is stupid - please ask it. Those are by far the most important questions. I don't care if you say "What should I Google?". That's an amazing question. 

Feel free to ask questions, ask for resources, or use Google/Youtube and other places to help you grow your knowledge. Nothing here is beyond your capacity to learn, understand and build. Assignments persist over time. Engage with them to see the progress of this application. Contribute to them, even if they're already answered, to gain experience or expand knowledge. You are encouraged to attempt, fail and grow here. As always, if it feels like you're not good enough, then you're definitely in the right place and need to keep moving forward.

#### Assignment
1. As you can see, the project is empty. There's are some random things we need to do to setup our project for personal and team use. Feel free to explore or suggest those things in a pull request. Report back what you think. That will count as valid work.

2. How are we going to initialize our React application? Will we use something like `create-react-app`? Why or why not? Should we use an entire product like Hydrogen by Shopify? What are the tradeoffs of our choices? There is no wrong answer here. Only justifications for what you believe as an engineer.


#### What you need to accomplish this task
Things you will need to do:
- Learn what branches or forks are on Github
- Learn what pull requests are on Github
- Study/understand React toolchains and setup frameworks.


**Expected Result:** 
-  A researchful discussion on starting a React project. Please include resources you found useful for future participants.

**Resume Result:**
- _collaborated and contributed to an education startup to determine which React environment and toolchain to use._

I know nothing about coding but I'm here from tiktok......
Okay weirdo, here's a 30 minute crash course on everything you need to know to find your way into the tech industry. It'll make you feel like you can definitely learn it. If you still feel scared to contribute to this project after, I recommend to pick up a course on Codecademy so you can learn what coding feels like.

1. This project originates from a TikTok channel that encourages disenfranchised communities and inspires individuals to learn. So the nature of this product is to be mindful of beginners. Things should be built and communicated in a way where any beginner can learn and understand. This allows even experts to improve because they're building from a position of teaching others, which is an ultimate form of securing knowledge and experience.

2. The culture here is predominantly Latino. We as Latinos tend to be survival experts and are culturally inclined to do more for less. Take some time to understand the consequences of that. Ultimately, we no longer want that to be true in future generations. [Please read my following letter to Latino youth and education dropouts](https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1665596886/A_Letter_To_You_3_gyhikq.pdf)

3. We want to fail faster and encourage curiousity. If something feels like it's too hard for you, then you should definitely continue to go in that direction until it becomes less scary. That's where you really make leaps in progress. <3

4. I'll be able to code sometimes. Progress can be slow, so be patient. Most of the times I'll be working on documentation or improving the learnability of this project. My primary function here is actually to "advertise" on TikTok so that people gain interest in the project. It's really possible for me to drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to this profile. Pretty crazy right? So you'll tend to find that communication is valued over code here. I recommend to value communication over code as well, and you'll see how empowering it can be. So feel free to use the material here on your own social medias too. I don't care if you pretend to be the owner of it or not. In fact, act like you are.

So at this point, you're probably familiar with the culture behind Robots Building Education. It's people driven.
If you haven't yet, please consider reading the Patreon and contributing to the larger idea behind it. I would argue that contributing to the project allows you to understand it differently, since you become a client of RO.B.E yourself and can see how it influences your desire to use it or change it.

# Educate
A platform for teachers

The following application will allow teachers to share and collaborate on resources for free. In RO.B.E tradition, there will be a financial system underneath it, where schools may pay for subscriptions that get redistributed based on its usage. So a teacher in Mexico and a Mexican-American teacher in New York can work together, or alone, and generate revenue for other schools.
The goal, as with any RO.B.E project, is to uplift, improve and empower the US public education system. So we must fundamentally serve students and teachers first, since they are the origin point for all systemic learning.
