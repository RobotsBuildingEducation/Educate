# Robots Building Education
<code>Version 0.0.4</code>

<img width="75%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/195417190-65cc2b05-9871-4a24-b81a-98a63125e509.png" />

Robots Building Education is an idea that I started in 2015. The software is informed by a design that seeks to create and embed scholarships into the process of learning. This is completely different than "learn-to-earn" ideas that you may see floating around to incentivize learning. You subscribe as you would to any other platform, or you're granted a seat by your organization/school budget, and that subsciption is redistributed to some other location that can better allocate and use that financial resource. So the design is informed by prioritizing the needs of people over profit. It is still private and will always act independently from influence of both private capital and public bureaucracy. How is that possible? A lot of hard work, patience, social currency and good will.

There is a much larger story to RO.B.E in the long term. But at this point, I feel comfortable sharing philosophy behind it as a way to drive inspiration and encouragement for folks who are looking for opportunities. To understand the project more, please read the following:

Ultimately, when understanding the philosophy behind RO.B.E more, you will understand that this work is a function of my belief that we should choose which problems we want to work on, contribute to, or solve. For me, that is equity in education and to create more access for undocumented children. I think education can be better and I think the internet hasn't done a good job at driving that change correctly. I don't believe I'm alone with that sentiment and I believe in some way you might be here for that reason too. So thanks for coming! It means a lot, even if you don't contribute.


# Getting started

<img width="720" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/195417035-6570009f-d3f2-42ce-a682-c86a55bb618f.png">

If you know nothing about coding but came here from Tiktok, I've compiled my tiktok playlist (which is not available to everyone) into a Youtube video. It will get better over time. It's a 30 minute crash course that covers what you need to generally learn so that you can break into the industry and covers it in simple langauge. The goal is to make it all feel less scary so that you spend more time believing in yourself and looking forward. I recommend to watch it while doing chores like washing dishes. 

Afterward, as mentioned in the "Letter To You", I recommend spending time on Codecademy or Fireship so that you can directly learn how to code more. Codecademy and Fireship both offer decent quality free content although I do recommend to use any trials or about a month of subscription. I'm not here to sell courses, but these are quality services and it's generally worthwhile.

# Culture

<img width="75%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/195417313-d75b6db7-35d1-47bf-9c89-7a8f07215997.png" />



1. This project originates from a TikTok channel that encourages disenfranchised communities and inspires individuals to learn. So the nature of this product is to be mindful of beginners. Things should be built and communicated in a way where any beginner can learn and understand. This also allows even experts to improve because they're building from a position of teaching others, which is an ultimate form of securing knowledge and experience.

2. The culture here is predominantly Latino. We as Latinos tend to be survival experts and are culturally inclined to do more for less. Take some time to reflect on the consequences of that. Ultimately, we no longer want that to be true in future generations.

3. We want to fail faster and encourage curiousity. If something feels like it's too hard for you, then you should definitely continue to go in that direction until it becomes less scary. That's where you really make leaps in progress. <3

4. I'll be able to code sometimes. Progress can be slow, so be patient. This speed is sacred. Education is complex and the more time you allow for things to influence your understanding, the better off we'll be. It's better to do things right in education than to take risks because we want to grow a business. This is not a business. This is a platform that seeks to solve problems.

5. Most of the times I'll be working on documentation or improving the learnability of this project. My primary function here is to "advertise" on TikTok so that people gain interest in the project. It's really possible for me to drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to this profile. Pretty crazy right? So you'll tend to find that communication is valued over code here. I recommend to value communication over code as well, and you'll see how empowering it can be. So feel free to use the material here on your own social medias too. I don't care if you pretend to be the owner of it or not. In fact, act like you are.


# Resume Building Project - Educate
A Platform For Teachers
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/195417469-b6b9d8bf-3654-4726-a3b6-b17ae675d83e.png)


The following application will allow teachers to share and collaborate on resources for free. In RO.B.E tradition, there will be a financial system underneath it, where schools may pay for subscriptions that get redistributed based on its usage. So a teacher in Mexico and a Mexican-American teacher in New York can work together, or alone, and generate revenue for other schools.
The goal, as with any RO.B.E project, is to uplift, improve and empower the US public education system. So we must fundamentally serve students and teachers first, since they are the origin point for all systemic learning.


I have created the first assignment - which is starting the project. Please remember that these assignments are designed to help beginners gain real experience. They should be challenging for beginners to an extent - but it's all possible to complete and you will learn and grow as an engineer as a result. I promise you that. Remember that this also helps experts, and many experts would look at this assignment and wouldn't immediately start to Google for more information because they themselves likely do not know. It's better to learn how to learn than to remember everything.

# Me - RO.B.E

Well my name is Sheilfer. But it's easier for people to do RO.B.E.

Here's what I'm working on:
  - Work on letter to reply to mentoring emails 
  - Work on an animated video to introduce Assignment 1 
  - Redo early videos in coding bootcamp speed run to create a uniform presentation for Tiktok and Youtube uploads 
  - Drive views to Github
  - Reply to IG DMs
  
What I recommend to myself:
 - solve common denominator problems 
   - mail count
   - extended session creating video revisions + new Latino Gang animation video
   
Nice to have
 - Better introduction to Latino Gang videos. Animated or not. Idk. Bet
