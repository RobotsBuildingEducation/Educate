# Educate
A platform for teachers

The following application will allow teachers to share and collaborate on resources for free. In RO.B.E tradition, there will be a financial system underneath it, where schools may pay for subscriptions that get redistributed based on its usage. So a teacher in Mexico and a Mexican-American teacher in New York can work together, or alone, and generate revenue for other schools.
The goal, as with any RO.B.E project, is to uplift, improve and empower the US public education system. So we must fundamentally serve students and teachers first, since they are the origin point for all systemic learning.

So at this point, you're probably familiar with the culture behind Robots Building Education. It's people driven.
If not please consider reading the Patreon and contributing to the larger idea behind it. I would argue that contributing to the project allows you to understand it differently, since you become a client of RO.B.E yourself and can see how it influences your desire to use it or change it.
