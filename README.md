Robots Building Education is an idea that I started in 2015. The software is informed by a design that seeks to create and embed scholarships into the process of learning. This is completely different than "learn-to-earn" ideas that you may see floating around to incentivize learning. You subscribe as you would to any other platform, or you're granted a seat by your organization/school budget, and that subsciption is redistributed to some other location that can better allocate and use that financial resource. So the design is informed by prioritizing the needs of people over profit. It is still private and will always act independently from influence of both private capital and public bureaucracy. How is that possible? A lot of hard work, patience, social currency and good will.

There is a much larger story to RO.B.E in the long term. But at this point, I feel comfortable sharing philosophy behind it as a way to drive inspiration and encouragement for folks who are looking for opportunities. To understand the project more, please read the following:

Ultimately, when understanding the philosophy behind RO.B.E more, you will understand that this work is a function of my belief that we should choose which problems we want to work on, contribute to, or solve. For me, that is equity in education. I think education can be better and I think the internet hasn't done a good job at driving that change correctly. I don't believe I'm alone in that belief and I believe in some way you might be here for that reason too. So thanks for coming! It means a lot, even if you don't contribute.


# Getting started

I know nothing about coding but I'm here from tiktok......
Okay lil g, here's a 30 minute crash course on everything you need to know to find your way into the tech industry. It'll make you feel like you can definitely learn it. If you still feel scared to contribute to this project after, I recommend to pick up a course on Codecademy so you can learn what coding feels like.

# Culture







1. This project originates from a TikTok channel that encourages disenfranchised communities and inspires individuals to learn. So the nature of this product is to be mindful of beginners. Things should be built and communicated in a way where any beginner can learn and understand. This allows even experts to improve because they're building from a position of teaching others, which is an ultimate form of securing knowledge and experience.

2. The culture here is predominantly Latino. We as Latinos tend to be survival experts and are culturally inclined to do more for less. Take some time to understand the consequences of that. Ultimately, we no longer want that to be true in future generations. [Please read my following letter to Latino youth and education dropouts](https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1665596886/A_Letter_To_You_3_gyhikq.pdf)

3. We want to fail faster and encourage curiousity. If something feels like it's too hard for you, then you should definitely continue to go in that direction until it becomes less scary. That's where you really make leaps in progress. <3

4. I'll be able to code sometimes. Progress can be slow, so be patient. Most of the times I'll be working on documentation or improving the learnability of this project. My primary function here is actually to "advertise" on TikTok so that people gain interest in the project. It's really possible for me to drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to this profile. Pretty crazy right? So you'll tend to find that communication is valued over code here. I recommend to value communication over code as well, and you'll see how empowering it can be. So feel free to use the material here on your own social medias too. I don't care if you pretend to be the owner of it or not. In fact, act like you are.

So at this point, you're probably familiar with the culture behind Robots Building Education. It's people driven.
If you haven't yet, please consider reading the Patreon and contributing to the larger idea behind it. I would argue that contributing to the project allows you to understand it differently, since you become a client of RO.B.E yourself and can see how it influences your desire to use it or change it.





# Educate
A platform for teachers
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/195417469-b6b9d8bf-3654-4726-a3b6-b17ae675d83e.png)


The following application will allow teachers to share and collaborate on resources for free. In RO.B.E tradition, there will be a financial system underneath it, where schools may pay for subscriptions that get redistributed based on its usage. So a teacher in Mexico and a Mexican-American teacher in New York can work together, or alone, and generate revenue for other schools.
The goal, as with any RO.B.E project, is to uplift, improve and empower the US public education system. So we must fundamentally serve students and teachers first, since they are the origin point for all systemic learning.




# RO.B.E
Well my name is Sheilfer. But it's easier for people to do RO.B.E.

Here's what I'm working on:
  - Work on letter to reply to mentoring emails
  - Work on an animated video to introduce Assignment 1
  - Redo early videos in coding bootcamp speed run to create a uniform presentation for Tiktok and Youtube uploads
  - Drive views to Github
  - Reply to IG DMs
  
What I recommend to myself:
 - solve common denominator problems 
   - mail count
   - extended session creating video revisions + new Latino Gang animation video
   
Nice to have
 - Better introduction to Latino Gang videos. Animated or not. Idk. Bet
