You know I always struggle so much with this one and after some rounds of therapy it's starting to be clear why. I started off as a content creator n 2020 as a writer on Reddit. I wrote about stocks and I was excited to introduce topics about technology that I felt people weren't aware of. I felt that I had an interesting relationship with understanding the market and how technology plays in it.

It's such a risky thing to do but "figuring out the answer of which stocks to pick" is such a lucrative thing that many people foolishly tried. This particular problem was something that eluded me from the beginning of Robots Building Education. I felt that I could teach people the right principles to investing, create investors and hopefully have them re-invest back into me. It's kind of a ridiculous concept and I never really knew how to finally "launch" it.

Well, what you see online is Robots Building Education, so I'm doing what I believe is right for this to work. It needs to be efficient and it needs to be push the boundary of what's capable. The goal is to make you a better investor, not to tell you what to invest in. Please, obsessively read everything about these businesses and their competitors to understand more.
So here goes nothing. 3 years of a lot of painstaking effort, stated clearly.

## The Stock Portfolio

<img width="100%" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-21 at 1 12 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/233803430-b4d93024-a20b-47e9-a87e-cb7317e38098.png">

I'm not going to go into all of the details of the things I learned. There are so many rules and regulations that define how I choose things.
In short, it helps to think of the market and businesses in terms of economic pipelines. There is a pipeline for everything, from the production of silk to music label regulations.They're pipelines of economic activity. Which pipelines look good to invest in?

Here is one thing I attribute a lot in the game of stock picking. Stewardship. Focusing on those things will help you address bias over the long term in the stock market.

Berkshire Hathaway (20%)
Berkshire Hathaway is an empire investment. I view Berkshire as actively invested American cash, so it's the first stock that I would trade in or sell. I invest in Berkshire because it's not an investment that I try to beat the market with, it's an investment of an organization and model that I trust.

They make money via highly profitable business across sectors like insurance, railroad, industrials, banking and consumer staples. They invest that money back into stocks.

Apple (30%)
Apple sells personal devices and extends them with services. Their products are ultimately centered around personal, private and self-investing technology. Similar to Berkshire Hathaway, they're invested in as a trusted place to store wealth.

Many investors tend to understand Apple's walled garden approach. I don't focus on that. They're in the business of creating private devices for consumers. This causes their products to center around privacy. I believe long term, consumers will value privacy-centric technology over social ones like Google and Meta.

Pinterest (20%)
Pinterest is a social network and search engine built around shopping, ideas and planning for the future. Women largely use it as a productivity tool. I believe that the value of their brand, reputation and economic incentives will result in creating one of the strongest advertisement networks.

In fact, it would not be surprising to see if more iPhone users allow Pinterest to collect their data over other less trusted networks like Instagram and Tiktok. Why? I recommend to think of social networks, ranging from Instagram to Amazon's Prime network, on a spectrum. The spectrum is defined by intention and entertainment.

Which networks are best at driving revenue? Which networks have designed an environment that's most productive for advertisements? Which network has the most influence over consumer awareness? How can that all change? When you think about networks from that perspective, you get to observe a lot of different constraints and advantages that some have over others.

Block (30%)
Block invests into primarily small businesses and individuals and reinvests their money into Bitcoin research. I believe there is a future of banking and that programmable money is a clear facet of life and I believe that Block is positioned to be a good steward of that future. There's also reality, where large banks like Chase and Bank of America are likely to persist and flourish too. I'm not much a zero-sum thinker when it comes to the competitive environment. I believe that it's likely that all major banking players are more likely to succeed than to fail.

That being said, the nature of banking is how well an organization manages deposits and risks. Block is a company that does a few things very well and manages its risk by offering safer financial services. It then offsets this risk by investing into Bitcoin research rather than depending on crypto's success to succeed as a company. It's still a classical financial services company.

I believe that their investments in Bitcoin will eventually pay off, and will allow them to grow vertically in a domain that many other companies are only investing partially into, names organizations like Visa, Mastercard and Chase. In fact, I believe that Block has the potential to be one of the largest organizations in the world in the future, if the status quo of organizations like Google, Apple and Microsoft achieve complete oligarch control of consumer technology.

<hr/>

I hope that you can appreciate some of the nuance and diversification in this 4 stock portfolio. If you do a deep dive into every business, I believe you will learn an enormous amount about the market. I will eventually write more on these if needed, but it's much lower priority. In the meantime, this will be the foundation of RO.B.E's financial arm, and I will be heavily investing into it.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm not going into great detail behind my process. The truth is I just spent an incredible amount of time reading about the market. It is difficult to explain. It's also difficult to summarize. Some rules are more important than others. It helps to think about the pipelines you're investing in.

When I had lower wealth, I was pretty good at picking out which things would result in exponential returns. I still do some of that, but I have more mastery over the subject now, and more responsibility too. This is the years long effort of that.

My hope is that I help some of you become incredible investors.

# Charlie Munger

Charlie Munger, the Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and a successful investor, has a unique investment philosophy that emphasizes patience, discipline, and long-term thinking. Here's a summary of how Charlie Munger invests:

Value investing: Munger follows a value investing approach, which involves identifying undervalued companies with strong fundamentals, competitive advantages, and potential for long-term growth. He looks for companies trading at a discount to their intrinsic value, providing a margin of safety.

Focus on quality: Munger believes in investing in high-quality businesses with strong management teams, sustainable competitive advantages (or "moats"), and a history of profitability. He prefers companies with easy-to-understand business models and a clear path to long-term success.

Concentrated portfolio: Unlike many investors who diversify their investments across a large number of companies, Munger prefers to hold a concentrated portfolio of a few high-quality businesses. This approach is based on the idea that a few great investments can produce significant returns over time.

Long-term orientation: Munger is a patient investor with a long-term investment horizon. He often holds his investments for many years or even decades, allowing the power of compounding to work in his favor. This approach reduces the impact of short-term market fluctuations and helps to minimize transaction costs.

Margin of safety: Munger emphasizes the importance of incorporating a margin of safety into investment decisions. This means purchasing stocks at a significant discount to their intrinsic value to account for potential errors in valuation or unforeseen negative events.

Avoiding common pitfalls: Munger is keenly aware of the cognitive biases and psychological tendencies that can lead to poor investment decisions. He works to minimize these influences by staying rational, disciplined, and humble.

Learning from multiple disciplines: Munger is an advocate of learning from various disciplines, such as psychology, economics, and history, to inform investment decisions. By developing a "latticework" of mental models, Munger believes investors can better understand the factors that impact businesses and markets.

In summary, Charlie Munger's investment approach is characterized by value investing, focusing on high-quality businesses, maintaining a concentrated portfolio, adopting a long-term perspective, incorporating a margin of safety, avoiding common cognitive biases, and learning from multiple disciplines. This disciplined and patient approach has contributed to Munger's long-term success as an investor.

Charlie Munger has extensively discussed the role of cognitive biases in decision-making, particularly in the context of investing. Munger believes that understanding and recognizing these biases can help individuals make better decisions in both their personal and professional lives. Here is a summary of Munger's views on biases:

Importance of mental models: Munger advocates for the use of mental models, which are frameworks or simplified representations of complex concepts, to help individuals understand and navigate the world. These mental models can help people identify biases and improve decision-making.

Latticework of mental models: Munger suggests that individuals should develop a "latticework" of mental models from various disciplines, including psychology, economics, and history. This interdisciplinary approach can help individuals recognize cognitive biases and make more informed decisions.

sychological tendencies: Munger has identified several psychological tendencies that contribute to cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, availability bias, overconfidence, and anchoring. He believes that being aware of these tendencies can help individuals avoid pitfalls in decision-making.

Influence of incentives: Munger emphasizes the importance of understanding incentives and how they can bias decision-making. He suggests that individuals should carefully consider the incentives that may be driving their own actions or the actions of others.

Reducing bias through rationality: Munger argues that cultivating rationality and consistently seeking to improve one's understanding of the world can help reduce the influence of cognitive biases. He encourages individuals to remain open-minded, humble, and adaptable in the face of new information.

In summary, Charlie Munger's views on bias emphasize the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of cognitive biases and psychological tendencies, cultivating rationality, and creating a latticework of mental models to improve decision-making. Recognizing and mitigating the influence of these biases can lead to better personal and professional outcomes.

# Warren Buffet

Warren Buffett, the Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the most successful investors of all time, follows a value investing approach, which he learned from his mentor, Benjamin Graham. Here's a summary of how Warren Buffett invests:

Value investing: Buffett's investment philosophy revolves around finding undervalued companies with strong fundamentals, competitive advantages, and potential for long-term growth. He focuses on the intrinsic value of a business, rather than short-term market fluctuations, to make investment decisions.

Business quality: Buffett looks for companies with easy-to-understand business models, strong management teams, and sustainable competitive advantages or "moats." These moats protect the company from competition and help maintain its profitability over the long term.

Long-term orientation: Buffett is a patient investor who believes in the power of compounding. He holds his investments for the long term, often decades, to maximize returns and minimize transaction costs. This long-term perspective allows him to focus on the underlying business performance rather than short-term market movements.

Margin of safety: Like Charlie Munger, Buffett emphasizes the importance of incorporating a margin of safety into investment decisions. This means purchasing stocks at a significant discount to their intrinsic value to protect against potential errors in valuation or unforeseen negative events.

Focus on cash flow: Buffett pays close attention to a company's cash flow generation and its ability to reinvest that cash profitably. He prefers businesses that can allocate capital efficiently and generate high returns on invested capital.

Diversification: While Buffett's investment approach is concentrated, he does believe in diversification to some extent. He invests in various industries and sectors, spreading risk across different types of businesses.

Avoiding leverage: Buffett avoids using excessive leverage or borrowed money to invest. He believes that using leverage magnifies both gains and losses, and it can lead to financial instability during market downturns.

Rationality and temperament: Buffett stresses the importance of having the right temperament and rationality as an investor. He believes in staying disciplined, avoiding herd mentality, and making investment decisions based on facts and analysis rather than emotions.

In summary, Warren Buffett's investment approach is based on value investing principles, focusing on high-quality businesses, adopting a long-term perspective, incorporating a margin of safety, emphasizing cash flow generation, maintaining some level of diversification, avoiding leverage, and staying rational and disciplined. This approach has made Buffett one of the most successful investors in history.

# Cathie Wood

Cathie Wood, the founder, CEO, and CIO of ARK Invest, has a distinct investment approach that emphasizes disruptive innovation and long-term growth. Her investment strategy contrasts with traditional value investing followed by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Here's a summary of how Cathie Wood invests:

Focus on disruptive innovation: Wood's investment philosophy revolves around identifying and investing in disruptive technologies and companies that have the potential to transform industries and create significant long-term growth. Examples of such technologies include artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, genomic sequencing, and blockchain.

Thematic investing: ARK Invest's actively managed funds are organized around specific themes or areas of innovation. This thematic approach allows Wood and her team to concentrate on sectors with high growth potential and identify companies that are leading the charge in those sectors.

Long-term orientation: Like Buffett and Munger, Wood is also a long-term investor. However, she focuses on companies with high growth potential rather than undervalued, stable businesses. This long-term perspective allows her to invest in companies that may be volatile in the short term but have the potential for substantial returns over time.

High-conviction positions: Wood's investment approach is characterized by high-conviction positions in a relatively small number of companies. This concentrated strategy enables her to maximize returns from her best ideas while maintaining a deep understanding of each company in her portfolio.

Active management: ARK Invest's funds are actively managed, meaning that Wood and her team continuously analyze and adjust their portfolios based on new information and market conditions. This active management approach allows them to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks more effectively than passive investment strategies.

Transparency and research: Wood places a strong emphasis on transparency and research. ARK Invest regularly shares its investment ideas, research, and even its trades with the public, fostering an open and collaborative investment environment.

Adapting to market changes: Wood is known for her ability to adapt to changing market conditions and pivot her investment strategy when necessary. This flexibility allows her to respond to new opportunities and challenges in the rapidly evolving world of disruptive innovation.

In summary, Cathie Wood's investment approach is centered around identifying and investing in disruptive innovation and high-growth companies, adopting a thematic and long-term orientation, taking high-conviction positions, actively managing her portfolios, emphasizing transparency and research, and adapting to market changes. This distinctive investment strategy has contributed to her success in recent years, particularly in the technology sector.

# Jack Bogle

Jack Bogle, the founder of The Vanguard Group and a pioneer in the investment industry, is best known for his advocacy of low-cost, passive investing through index funds. His investment philosophy is centered around long-term investing and minimizing costs for investors. Here's a summary of how Jack Bogle invests:

Passive investing: Bogle's investment approach emphasizes passive investing through index funds, which are designed to track the performance of a specific market index, like the S&P 500. He believes that most actively managed funds do not consistently outperform their benchmark indices over the long term, especially after accounting for fees and expenses.

Low-cost investing: Bogle was a strong advocate for reducing costs in investing. He argued that minimizing fees and expenses, such as management fees and trading costs, is one of the most effective ways to improve long-term investment returns. Vanguard's low-cost index funds were created to provide investors with a cost-effective way to access diversified market exposure.

Diversification: Bogle believed in the importance of diversification as a way to manage risk and achieve more consistent returns. By investing in index funds, investors gain exposure to a broad range of companies, sectors, and asset classes, which can help to mitigate the impact of individual security risks.

Long-term orientation: Bogle encouraged investors to adopt a long-term perspective and to stay the course through market fluctuations. He advised investors to avoid market timing, as it is difficult to predict short-term market movements consistently.

Focus on simplicity: Bogle's investment philosophy emphasizes simplicity, both in terms of investment strategy and portfolio construction. He encouraged investors to avoid complex investment products and strategies, as they often lead to higher costs and increased risks.

Rebalancing: Bogle advised investors to periodically rebalance their portfolios to maintain their desired asset allocation. This disciplined approach can help investors avoid being overly concentrated in a particular asset class or sector, reducing risk and potentially improving long-term returns.

Investing versus speculating: Bogle distinguished between investing and speculating, stressing that true investing involves focusing on the underlying fundamentals and long-term performance of a security or market, rather than attempting to profit from short-term price movements.

In summary, Jack Bogle's investment approach is characterized by passive investing through low-cost index funds, diversification, a long-term orientation, simplicity, periodic rebalancing, and a focus on true investing rather than speculation. This philosophy has been widely adopted by individual investors and has led to the growth of the passive investing industry, particularly in the form of low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

# Investing In Financial Technology

## The First Generation Investor: Financial Technology & Cryptocurrency

A thought:

The future of education will more closely express what learning is: an expression of effort, time, and energy. The future of education will not fit in previous models defined by arbitrary institutions that brokerage trust through "education" certifications.

3. Financial Technology Investing
   Consider the following relationship:

An eighteen year old Black American can date their family back hundreds of years to some enslaved origin point. This same American is a pioneer in the family name as they invest in the US stock market for the first time in 2020. After several world revolutions, political movements and scientific advancements, an internet application had finally amended the fair access to the financial service.

Financial technology is ultimately defined by and understood with critical race theory. Critical race theory is the philosophy behind the intersection of race, history, and power. The entire financial system is a system that attempts to govern and monitor the risk of each transaction by proving that the individual behind the transaction is not committing some kind of crime. This statement alone is worth multiple conversations which need to come together into one cohesive idea.

So we need to illustrate the conversations behind race, history, power and the access to resources in order to understand the direction of the current financial technology industry. Decentralization, at its core, is the redistribution of power granted by some central entity or entities, so it only makes sense to observe critical race theory and its intersection with transforming technology.

I find it fascinating that many Black Americans today are essentially immigrants to their own country where the first fair rights were afforded only just a few decades ago. In my view, critical race theory allows someone to consider the special conditions of groups with native and genocided origins. In the North American case, we would observe the power struggles experienced by Black Americans, the indigenous, and Hispanics. In Asia, we would observe groups in North Korea.

In Eurasia, we can observe groups like the Israelis. The simple truth here is that genocides have far reaching consequences across many generations. Understanding and respecting the value of critical race theory allows you to observe truly phenomenal relationships. Let us set up one modern struggle: the US drug war, the demographics of incarcerated Americans, and the violence experienced south of the US border. Then let us observe the nature of trust as the ultimate form of value in the financial system.

A simple and safe transaction in any given scenario between a merchant and customer would be a cash transaction. I agree to purchase a good or service with a US note backed by some credit reserve and the money instantly settles due to it being in the form of cash. This entire system completely fails if I offer you a convincing counterfeit bill.

So then this issue of trust can be observed regionally, where cash transactions may vary in risk at a highway gas station versus some mall in a city suburb. The point here is that, despite the simple circumstances, much can still fundamentally go wrong.

The entire process then transforms in complexity at the digital stage. There are entire systems and economies that are built to monitor and verify this trust between merchant and customer that then produces the infamous service and brokerage fee. This cash does not instantly settle, so the spender must spend in order to use their own money as a way to counteract the risk associated with making transactions digitally.

What is challenging about the digital system is that it depends on legal frameworks that are based on power and liberty. They are compliant standards that require an individual to prove that they are not a blacklisted immigrant, criminal, or terrorist through the form of various sensitive documentations like a social security number or personal address.

What this means is that just about every digital financial system functions off of a “verify first, trust later” model that effectively has you prove that you are not a criminal in order to use their discriminate systems. It is at this point where you might see that cryptocurrency advocates are encouraged to look for new systems that destructure and challenge the power struggles created by these legal frameworks.

I hope that by this point, the reader can begin to see the relationships I’m trying to illustrate between historical powers, race, and financial institutions. In short, the US has staged some militant status quo involving drugs, terrorism, and the financing of systemic war, while also maintaining a financial system that monitors crime and terrorism. This relationship expresses itself in rather perverse ways. For example, is the security at an airport meant for airplane safety or is it just an incredibly cheap way to monitor immigration status?

These legal frameworks have generational consequences on job availability, school funding, and access to many basic resources like safety and banking that govern our day to day life. How could one expect for a bank to survive in areas that are overpoliced, where jobs are erased, and where deposits decrease in supply?

So returning back to the conversation about race and power, one can observe fascinating relationships and problems worth solving. The financial technology industry is often driven by this narrative of amending services for the underbanked. When you observe the underbanked in North America, you see the same pattern - Black Americans in the southern US states, underdeveloped city “sides”, and nations south of the border. This is by design. Systems of modern finance are built off of those systems of trust that we outlined above.

What this design says is that these groups and regions are the least trusted groups, which is also true from a power perspective. One could see how this tragically results in a rather dangerous feedback loop and one could argue how this is one of the many forms of structural racism generated and maintained by the US technology industry.

The end result is an imbalance of power in the US, resulting in a lose-lose for its society. The failures of the drug war, its resulting incarcerations, and widespread overconsumption of drugs and policing is a product of this imbalanced power. My view is that race is only a circumstance of the nature of power and history, and in the case of the US, it’s worth deeply observing as it is uniquely positioned as a society in world history.

So with this entire context in mind, it becomes a lot easier to understand the significance of Bitcoin development and it's growing social currency in regions that have issues regarding transactions, trust, and violence like Latin America or Africa. Bitcoin believes in the inverse of the current system, a "trust first, verify later" model.

It also allows you to understand the entire ecosystem that drives organizations like Square and Robinhood. Whether it be services for small businesses, artists, or investors, the narrative remains the same: democratize financial services. Democratization logically follows conversations of liberty and power! Using this mental model, one can more critically observe the relationships that drove Jay-Z to join the board of Square, or Square's development of credit services that don't depend on credit checking.

The end result is that Square and other financial services are seeking ways to minimize risk and trust associated with digital transactions to reduce the overall cost of business and to enhance the delivery and accessibility of services. This is why I'm confident in financial technology's ability to transform and and improve our previous system.

And this framework is what allows me to understand and predict Square's roadmap in industries that it is not involved in yet, like education funding and home owner loan issuances.

Disclaimer
These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.

I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.

I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult.

It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.

Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others.

I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

If you prefer a more visual version, read the following essay here: https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Testify

After the recent failures of FTX along with the tech recession, I figured it would be good to review the fundamentals, since it seems that most people move on from the fundamentals too quickly during speculative markets.

To keep it brief, I started learning about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sometime around 2015 when I was studying operating systems in school. It just made sense to me as a digital native. Today, I work as an engineer at a financial technology company that’s focused on embedded finance and open-banking.

I’m going to keep things pretty simple and in plain language so that more people can understand, but at the end of the day it’s really not that complicated. The hard part is trying to understand what information is actually worthwhile, productive, truthful and creative.

If you want to skip ahead and do your own research, I recommend to follow and study these organizations in order:

- Bank Secrecy Act
- The US Drug War
- Bitcoin
- AMD Xilinx
- Block (Cash App’s parent company)
- Bluesky
- IPFS
- USDC
- Dogecoin
- Cloudflare

Anyway the Proof of Work system that governs Bitcoin is pretty easy to illustrate. Machines use energy to perform work. Bitcoin takes it one step further and assigns an economic value to that relationship.

So why does that matter? Well the reality is that technology is going to continue to advance, grow and automate things we once did. Productivity will go up and the nature of work will change. This has already happened.

We aren’t used to assigning salary to the work performed by an AI algorithm or the work done by a robot but we eventually will.
So Bitcoin creates a relationship out of what happens when machines physically do work and the salary created out of it.

To review, machines are using tiny pieces of chemicals and metals to create all the stuff that we see on the internet. So our shared digital space, when you really think about it, is still very physical. It burns energy and consumes oil no different than a car engine or a factory plant.

In a nutshell, as machines and networks improve, so will Bitcoin. Many people appreciate that simplicity.
Proof of Stake, on the other hand, depends on people’s contribution and participation in the system. It depends on adoption. I’m not going to say that Proof of Stake is inherently bad or wrong, but it comes with risks that people seem to ignore.

Proof of Stake depends on being able to trust others when participating in the system. It can lead to successful inventions or foolish failures. We can appreciate this truth when looking at fiat systems, governed by reserves, ordered by governments and informed by other structural conditions of society that have us participate in various economic and market systems.

In my view, Bitcoin and its influence over the market is far more compelling from an innovative and social perspective. It has a wonderful forward path in the ability to create a future economy that’s informed by automation, productivity and intelligent computing. From a political perspective, this seems to be related to our inevitable considerations of universal basic income.

From a cultural perspective, Bitcoin seems to endorse security, privacy and a more fair internet. A more fair space. This has resulted in the development of projects that allow users to navigate between social services. For example, if I were to get banned from TikTok, I would not lose my following and could use a service on Twitter instead to reach my audience.

If I wanted to buy a service or item, I don’t have to go through several layers of applications to create that exchange. I would be able to receive Venmo transactions from my Cash App. It’s digital cash. It's a way where I can represent my identity in the digital space without state-sanctioned verifiers and credentialers.

Bitcoin doesn’t seek to convince others to join it. It convinces engineers to rethink and expand services that already exist.
So here’s the issue with crypto, media, influence and the market.

It’s often a victim of stakeholder capitalism. I think Charlie Munger illustrated it best:
“Big-shot businessmen get into these waves of social proof. Do you remember some years ago when one oil company bought a fertilizer company, and every other major oil company practically ran out and bought a fertilizer company? And there was no damned reason for all these oil companies to buy fertilizer companies, but they didn’t know exactly what to do, and if Exxon was doing it, it was good enough for Mobil, and vice versa. I think they’re all gone now, but it was a total disaster.”

So that’s the same reason why, despite being an expert, most people would dismiss my idea that Dogecoin has more economic value than 99.9% of cryptocurrencies. It’s the reason why something like an NFT can be suddenly compelling and earth-shaking rather than just a modest feature for already existing services. Dogecoin is a simple proof-of-work system that was born out of an idea that tried to improve Bitcoin.

Its reputation is loved and respected. Its social recognition is far greater than even that of Ethereum. If you were to ask a young individual today which coin they liked the most, without considering the possibility of profit or “winning the crypto game”, I would wager most people would elect Dogecoin.
But unfortunately, stakeholder capitalism is a game of bias, trust and relationships.

We will be focusing on that economic reality in this writing often, and you’ll often see me disregard financial statements or other regurgitated content in financial media. This is about understanding what drives real innovation and impact in the market.

So why are engineers and innovators so interested in Bitcoin or these blockchains in the first place? How does it relate to Jay Z? One ought to consider the context of Black American history and the consequence of systemic oppression that muddies much of American history.

Much deeper conversations can be read in books like “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration In The Age Of Colorblindness” and “Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools For The New Jim Code”. However in our case, we can observe the history of the policies that govern the financial technology industry.
The financial technology industry is largely an extension of the banking sector.

It must follow so-called regulations revolving around anti-money laundering and financial crimes. I’m not here to write about the political currency of this implementation, but its origin is in 1970, only a few years after the completion of the Civil Rights Acts and one year prior to the launch of the Drug War.

What I’m trying to say here is that it’s not much of a coincidence why Bitcoin or cryptocurrency became an element of international drug trade in places like the Silk Road or Dark Web.
It’s also not a coincidence why folks like Charlie Munger are not fond of the system. According to investors like Charlie Munger, these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime.

But what this also means is that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first that must essentially verify that you aren't an undocumented immigrant, a drug trading criminal, or a terrorist. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, access to loans, and other means of securing wealth which is exactly where banks fall into institutional oppression.

They're systems we are either unaware of or numb to - but they are wrong. They are unfair and unjust. Frankly, Charlie Munger could never be someone like Jay Z either.
And this history matters so much. It explains why gangster rap was created. It explains today’s connection of hip-hop to our history of colonization and slavery. It defines our attitudes, culture and perception of our space.

One might think it’s a stretch, but you couldn’t log onto a platform like Tiktok today and livestream with cannabis present. Machine learning algorithms would detect it and temporarily suspend you from streaming. It also informs the economic reality that recently trusted cannabis shops will be built with Square websites, using Square payment systems, with customers using their Cash Apps and Cash Cards so that they can exchange cannabis legally in the financial technology network.

One could appreciate how Cash App allows for an alternative payment system where users don’t agree to inform machine learning algorithms about their transactions. There is no all-seeing eye to examine what I transacted. When examining the industry critically, you can see how these artificially intelligent machines become statistically more strict with names impacted by these anti money laundering acts.

The Fundamental Constraint
MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B\*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services.

The Underbanking Map
This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established.

These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy.

This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

The KYC Bottleneck
Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

The KYC Solution
It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless.

It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

The Underbanked
Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

The playbook
Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers.
No really, go ahead and look at two things:

- Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy

Urban strategy
Youth strategy

- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

Underbanking strategy
It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources.

What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

The ability to start a business
The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
The ability to save on basic purchases
The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

Reality
What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

Speculation
This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:
Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings.

Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.

Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.

Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
Square will foray into equal housing.
Square will improved loan systems.
Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.

# 2. Social Media Investing

You know, before formally introducing this writing, I have to admit that there is a particular challenge when it comes to writing this book and that is modifying for correct predictions or fundamental market shifts. This statement existed in the financial technology chapter but makes more sense to move up here in the technology introduction where we discuss the evolution of social media.

That is because the subject of conversation for the next few years will be the metaverse or the third iteration of the internet. This subject of conversation was essentially referenced in this chapter but the information is far more clear now and requires this final edit or revision. So let's begin.

It likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior. I like to invest in what I frame as intent-based social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet.

An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. In short, social media exists on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many others in the middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.

This spectrum is critical to understand because it governs what kind of algorithms are used to drive the platform. In the case of entertainment-based media, like Instagram or TikTok, the platform seeks to understand the user so that it can fetch content that will entertain them.

Entertainment is a highly subjective endeavor which forces the platforms to depend on algorithms to connect users and content. It is the open field form. On the other side, the intent-based platform serves a designed function and relationship with the content creator.

For example, we visit Pinterest to create useful ideas, allowing content-creators to focus on the context of the platform. Google indexes websites so that users can portal into a library of website owners and services. Reddit curates loyal communities to drive its information and space.

The critical element of this spectrum is the complex conversations that drive privacy and security on platforms. Social media is how we interface with the internet and it is what we refer to as the second iteration of the internet. To briefly shift the tone of this conversation, the entertainment platform suffer from misinformation and propaganda driven campaigns.

This is a natural consequence of relying on algorithms that depend on short and effective messaging and may ultimately affect intent-based platforms that orbit closer to entertainment, like Reddit or Youtube. They are called Influencers after all. The conversations surrounding privacy ultimately discuss these worst-case scenarios, so they're important to be mindful of historically and forward-looking.

With this issue highlighted, I would like to admit that one of my prediction about Facebook was correct. It will exist in social media forever, due to most applications using Facebook's software development ecosystems to create websites and applications on any device.

This is similar to how Oracle will essentially exist forever as part of the computing world due to its widespread demand for system maintenance and improvements. This is set in stone and Facebook's drive for the metaverse ultimately points to how the leadership behind Facebook understands that social media is a forum that ebbs and flows with the population over time.

So let's explore the thinking behind the leading social media platform and why it knows how to navigate and pivot its product over the years and how it lead to Roblox becoming Facebook's primary competitor for the next decade by examining Pinterest so that we can understand what social media truly is as a first generation investor.

A social media platform is a forum. A forum is a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way. Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, while Pinterest is used to search for ideas.

Pinterest is a particularly interesting case due to hundreds of millions of women adopting the platform and achieving what Google+ had failed to accomplish - a social media platform that harnesses the power of search. I believe this is also an interesting examination of how influential women are to the market. One can question if Apple or Google would be as successful as they are without the seismic changes that the American workforce has adapted.

This spectrum distinction continues be important when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistake the differences between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart.

So is Pinterest a social media platform, search service, or both? With this in mind, we might begin to see why Facebook implementing a hashtag, Instagram implementation stories, or TikTok implementing streams may be irrelevant when understanding the full potential of a service like Snapchat or Twitter and the wisdoms the drive its growth in the market. Before ever investing in a company you need to discover and completely understand the incentives that drive the customers to return to the product.

Without that, you are ultimately gambling in the market and driving through a fog hoping that things will turn out well.

What drives a social networking site is a user’s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution.

Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

The forum may take on a different medium. Google is used to answer information, Facebook allows us to connect, while online gaming satisfies our needs for adventure. When you examine the nature of a forum and a user’s incentive to participate in that forum, you’ll come to understand why a applications like Twitter, Pinterest, or online games like Roblox are a force of nature.

These forums engage and fulfill our very real needs and demands as social beings. It will also help you understand why companies like Facebook would endeavor in metaverse products like virtual reality games and other forms of social media.

Pinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or Reddit, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. This is what is known as “personal media” rather than typical “social media”.

This is a characteristic that I believe grants a media platform a longer product lifespan. It will also be quite relevant when it comes to conversations about how users interact with the metaverse. Clearly, there will be users that enjoy the extroverted elements of it, while introverted users may prefer the personal media aspects of it. What I try to imagine is that the Instagram "mall" may be a more social space than the Pinterest "mall" in the metaverse.

The network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine rather than an application to connect with friends or family.

As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly. This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption. Most American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users.

These customers are voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s customers are in a high willingness to engage with things that result in action. In other words, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future.

Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is effectively a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top "real estate" advertisements.

With a simple search, you’re welcomed to a rich library of consumable ideas for health, gifts, beauty, travelling, home developments, and millions of other regularly marketed products that influence the home.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the platform as a power tool. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment.

It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different from Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking. It is less wasteful and more effective.

You may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new.

As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less "the web", where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.

Due to this relationship, it is in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.

This partially explains why searching for "Lebron James" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites. Similarly, searching for "Vegan food near me" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.

There are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb; the more well-developed a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of well-developed changes.

An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develop tools like in-app browsers and support integration with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader of the internet. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe.

The internet is ultimately the access to information, which is as statistically scarce as the access to clean water and sanitation around the globe. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life and scale as one of the most valuable internet properties similar to how Roblox breeched the family household and maintained relevancy over the years.

I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest and things like Roblox are a reliable and effective advertising space.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I regularly seek to delete it. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest, I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. And Facebook is pivoting itself to exist in such a way that it is impossible to delete. That, to me, is incredible.

These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.

I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.

I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult.

It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.

Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others.

I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

Welcome to the metaverse!
TL;DR
Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability
Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills.

"We plan to continue to make acquisitions and investments in other companies, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and significantly harm our business. As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, features, and technologies. For example, in 2020 we acquired Ceebr Limited, a company that operated a platform that teaches children age 6-13 to design, program, and play their own games." - Roblox S-1

Roblox acquisitions in education technology spaces

Video Games & Heutagogic Learning
It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat.

For example:
The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: engagement. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition.

Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies. When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

First generation fintech and banking services
I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

"An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.
Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.
Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.
Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.
Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect."
In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development
In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

Heutagogic learning
Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey. In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.

What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:
The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
The ability to deeply engage.
The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of "learning the game" of stock market investing.

We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games. Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

Andragogic/Heutagogic learning at scale

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea.

Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:
It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.

The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

Second generation online gaming

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game?

Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy?

Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.
Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction
With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.

It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:
STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

Game development, code, or design
What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills.

These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.
One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

“Why do I need to learn this?”
It turns out, the answer is not
“so you can become a scientist!”
but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality
“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.

For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

Socioeconomic consequences in education support

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field.

Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
Engagement mentioned 160 times.
This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

"The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time."

1989
The Roblox Vision
"We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors."

EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020

In 2023: updates found here:
https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/economics#cash-payout-structure

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.
There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies.

What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as "disruption". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on.

There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:
The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:
Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

"Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program."

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists?

At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform.

This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:
" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world.

Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.

Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is Robox."

Conclusion
There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.
A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

Some essays are better than others. I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

Investing in Internet Forums
Let’s keep one question in mind:
Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution.

Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

Pinterest-as-a-Search-Service
The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:
Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.

Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

The power of incentives
With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:
Google (need for information)
Games (need for adventure)
Reddit (need for community)
Pinterest (need for ideas)
Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways in an attention-economy (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok, Roblox).

I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.

I also believe that its physical network advantage is growing thinner.

Instagram entered Shops to compete with Pinterest, not Amazon.
Take some time to think about why this relationship exists.
Searching
Consider this economic relationship.
What are the demographics of male underwear shoppers and who do male underwear brands market to? Women. Why?

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences across global households.

What this ultimately results in product education, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine for ideas, rather than a local-friendgroup site. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.

An incredible economic relationship occurring at global scale.
This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers regardless of culture.

You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:

- Recipe, Exercise, and Diet ideas (Peloton)
- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)
- Skincare ideas (Target, Hims & Hers)
- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)
- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)
- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space.

Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future.

This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high “willingness to engage” as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else.
Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content.

It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.

The Design
Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:
Security & Privacy
High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.
Vectors for advertisers
A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

Progressing Web Standards
The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, DDash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe.

The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.
Summary
I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life.

I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces; as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.
