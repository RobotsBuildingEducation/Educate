# Storytelling

Explore ideas at a high level. These concepts can be applied to essays, videos, stories, musical orchestrations and so forth. They’re recursions of each other.

#### INTRO (FIRST 2 SECONDS)
Create a hook

1. Set expectations 
Meet the expectations set by the header text and first shot

#### INTRO (FIRST 15 SECONDS)
Create commitment

1. Context
Make the video make sense

2. Introduce the stakes 
How will you be rewarded for watching? 
How much energy was put into creating this?

3. Knowledge sharing
What trail or breadcrumbs of information can you provide?

#### BODY
Create engagement

1. Camera motion
change the space every 2-5 seconds to capture words, thoughts or frames
Study films like The Titanic to understand things like suspense or emotion

2. Scripts
Add additional conversations like jokes, flashbacks, or additional narratives
Have periods where you heat up and cool down the plot. Too much energy is exhausting, not enough energy is boring. Break these into larger subframes of the video that capture a block of scenes.


#### CONCLUSION
Create reward

1. Payoff and reward
Either introduce the result or complete the result
End with a tone or message, generally something positive, funny, wholesome etc.


2. Scripts
Add additional conversations like jokes, flashbacks, or additional narratives
Have periods where you heat up and cool down the plot. Too much energy is exhausting, not enough energy is boring. Break these into larger subframes of the video that capture a block of scenes.


REVISIONS
Create improvements

Get feedback
Where does it feel stale?
Where does the context lose sense?
Do people’s behavior change while watching something?
Ask for thoughts or reviews




# SEO
I don't have a formal background in this. I became aware of SEO back in 2014, shortly after my brother had graduated from college in marketing and communications.

I became more familiar with it deeper into my career and began to apply it more to grow rapidly on with Robots Building Education on Tiktok. I'm going to give you some general purpose foundations, but we'll use Google as a specific examples.

Here's one foundation:

Every social media platform ranks things differently. Most social media platforms have a predictable algorithm based on the data it tries to collect and use to incentivize participation in a social network.

Sheilf, what does that mean? In almost all cases, social media platforms greatly rank their title properties:

LinkedIn professional titles
The text hooks people include in tiktok introductions
Google website titles and descriptions
There are a number of things that you can do to "shape" the direction of search, but they're usually not nearly as impact as the actual product that you're issuing out into the world. 

Think of it this way, using a hashtag like #computerscience is the equivalent to adding a label to a product. Now, what actually matters more in the business world: the product being purchased or the labels on it?

Once you really understand how generally simple it is, e.g a business like LinkedIn is obviously going to care about job titles more than anything, you can start strategizing.

Auto Detailing In LA and San Bernardino

So I had a 1-on-1 meeting with someone this weekend and we went over SEO for a business he's creating. The ask was "how do we get my business populating better on Google".

So first thing we have to ask is, "what do people search when they search for this kind of business?"

We can take an educated guess that people will likely prompt "<Product Needed>[Location]", so in this case it would be "Auto detailing San Bernardino"

We can see that this results aren't that competitive. Now let's think about Google as a business again. It's a mini library for the internet, it's also a business that must grow and profit, and it has limited context.

There's also another massive iceberg underneath, where google is likely able to process a number of details about your business and company. Services like Wix or other SEO providers likely make it easier by "wiring" some of these things up - but you can never really undervalue the level of engineering going on behind some of these platforms. For example, it's likely that Google measures how quickly your app will load as part of its ranking reccommendation or the location of the searcher.



Anyway, let's keep things simple - Google has a limited amount of context to compare. You have the website, a title, and them some website descriptions. So what happens if I look up something like Lebron James or better yet, Sheilfer? Well now you can see Google's business machine more clearly.

What you get are ads, wikipedia, social media, public media and not lebronjames.com. So what does that mean for you and your business?

This is what I recommend, very simply:

Understand what words best describe your line of business
Create a network of the words across various social media platforms.
Don't be afraid to experiment with titles. Changing your SEO is like changing your headquarters. 


This is a great example of what not to do:
