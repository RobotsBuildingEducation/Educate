So I came across this tweet and I thought it was an interesting lesson to be learned from someone's incompetence in a position of leadership. Just about everyone knows that there are two types of leadership: top-down and bottom-up, and there's a time and place for both of them.

Here's a simple rule of thumb. If you're managing experts, err on the side of being a top-down leader. If you're managing beginners, err on the side of being a bottom-up leader.

In the case that you're managing experts, it's just easier to delegate tasks and ideas because experts are generally self-sufficient. They have enough experience to know when to put in their part and when to ask for help.

In the event that you're managing beginners, it makes sense to create an environment that supports success for the individual. This means that you have to provide the means to facilitate growth. You have to be thoughtful and continuously ask, "how can I make this easier for them?"

So it's going to be more work on your part, but that's better than having unmet expectations. In a lot of ways, it's like creating bumpers in a bowling lane. It isn't because the beginner is incompetent or stupid - it's just that an expert has to empathize how difficult it actually is to be a beginner at something and how easy it is to go and stay in the wrong direction.

This is ultimately the difference between me being able to manage 700+ individuals that may be interested in meetings, and have each meeting be fairly successful with a wide range of interests, versus someone (who I know for a fact didn't have that many meetings and is probably inventing a story for social media) who folds there hands and gives up on an idea because things didn't go their way without the right setup.

And really at the end of the day what did I do to achieve that? It was just a simple meeting agenda template that asked a few thoughtful questions that lets you actually be a human being that's trying to figure things out.

This logic doesn't just apply to managing folks. It's ultimately a design problem related to user experiences. So, stepping away from people, consider the difference between devices by Apple vs. custom build operating systems and machines. Which one is a bottom-up leader and how was that choice critical for its success?
