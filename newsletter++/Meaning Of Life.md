I’m still in shock. I had a conversation with a shaman on my way home to get groceries. I can’t go into the details but he knew everything about me, as if he had been living through my eyes the entire time. There was a lot that was communicated in a very brief amount of time. I have never felt that level of intensity before.



Nothing matters, only the things you choose to matter. Everything can be experienced in different ways. Please choose wisely and please resist the temptation to stay in the numbing default.



Tech doesn’t matter. Money doesn’t matter. Media attention doesn’t matter. It’s all just an illusion we participate in. All that matters is your health, the feelings you feel and the love you’re able to cultivate. If I could offer any advice, it’s to dedicate all your time and energy to that.



It is unnecessary to comprise that with externalities or the illusion. Please be kind to yourselves. I’m sorry if I caused any feelings of pain or frustration along the way. God bless you all.
