Introduction

Learning how to pick stocks, investments and good businesses takes months and years of effort to understand. 
So the practice of focus investing is not intended for beginners.

This guide is not intended to teach people about focus investing and the thought patterns behind it. It's meant
to direct people toward being responsible beginners. It will be kept fairly short. You can start practicing with as little
as $1/mo.

You'll create different investing accounts over your lifetime the same way youll use different payment cards. I like Robinhood because they keep making what people need. This referal link will get you started with them.


How To Think About Money Allocation


Alright, the hard part. You have money and you want to put it to work in the market. When you're lower-income, some of these movements don't feel worth it because compounding money doesn't work in your favor. This is a lot like wanting to learn how to punt an American Football instead of playing the game of American Soccer - yes you can have fun blasting a ball or you can learn how to play the game and stand a chance in the field.


Investing in time
Investing in your retirement accounts is investing in time. This means you want to max out what is supplied here. If you want to play fast and loose with opportunity, the absolute minimum should be investing in whatever you get matched. I'm not sure how more obvious I can make this - you have to ask yourself if the money you're receiving is more valuable than time. In most cases, it's not, and as a result, your economic behavior will adjust because you're investing in a better currency.

How well you do this is also a good indicator at how well you understand credit and debt, which is an inverse relationship on time investing. Typically, you aren't always leveraging debt and inversely, you're almost always leveraging retirement. Money experts will have a number of different strategies - I do a 90% stock / 10% bonds split.

Investing in choice
Investing and Bitcoin people will sometimes make the case that cash is trash for whatever reason. This overcomplicates what cash is. Cash gives you access to choice. Your "emergency fund" is really just a tool to give you more choice while you're employed. I never own much of an emergency fund these days since focused investing tends to have you deliberating on what choices to make.

Investing in the market
The next pillar is investing in the overall market. You need to start diversified because you're at the point of maximum ignorance. As your ignorance over the subject matter declines, your focus and the quality of your decisions will improve.

So start with the S&P500 (SPY) - you're investing in "the top 500" US public companies. This will give you a similar return to youre retirement accounts since it's operating a similar way. 

I like to recommend this beginner portfolio: 33% into SPY, 33% into berkshire hathaway and 33% held in cash. This portfolio will help you get started on your journey with learning how to make choices in the stock market. 

Investing in the work
After this, there is a direct relationship with how much you read and how much you understand. You will not make it if you don't cultivate a love for learning, since the market carries enormous intersectional bodies of work that are constantly clashing and transforming. Reading is money and you only need a few homeruns to achieve most goals before time, faith, family and health massively overweigh and overshadow meaning through labor.

Conclusion
That's all. Short and sweet. Most people don't successfully reach past this point in their investing careers because the water starts to get awfully dangerous. Intuition, logic and intense psychological factors start to interact after this level because the science of reasoning is not a simple concept. Really one of the hard parts is that you're working with exponential numbers and exponential data operates in ways that many people are unfamiliar with. As you read and learn more, you understand what is meant by "diversification is protection against ignorance.".
