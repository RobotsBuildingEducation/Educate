## The Elon Musk Algorithm & Lean Manufacturing


### What are lean operations?
This is the mental model that Elon Musk uses to build the organizations he leads:

- **Question every requirement.** Each should come with the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a requirement came from a department, such as from "the legal department" or "the safety department." You need to know the name of the real person who made that requirement. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. Always do so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements less dumb.

- **Delete any part or process you can.** You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough.

- **Simplify and optimize.** This should come after step two. common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.

- **Accelerate cycle time.** Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that I later realized should have been deleted.

- **Automate.** That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.


Regardless how we feel about Elon, we can come to a conclusion that his organizations are effective. As it stands now, the greatest achievement under his belt has been the manufacturing process and industrial engineering that drives Tesla. That may seem like exaggeration but getting that down
right essentially feels the rest of his endeavors behind SpaceX, X and other high-risk ventures.

Folks that are in the manufacturing sector may already be familiar with lean manufacturing or may be aware of some workplace organizational methods, and a lot pretty much goes back to the basics of the lean process.
Historically, global manufacturing has seen different evolutions in different places around the world, which is why we may see some influence from places like Japan, Germany and South Korea. In the future, this may continue to rhyme as we see more wisdom from modern manufacturing nations like Mexico and China.

It's helpful to think about lean manufacturing when you're thinking about building a business. The essence of the concept is to focus on resourcefulness. Like all systems, it has positives and drawbacks.
Let's highlight a key drawback:

- As the name suggests, you're running a risk with the amount of resources you're utilizing. There is less room for error since errors will cause more damage. You are more vulnerable to disruptions. Upskilling is important to keep the process alive and well. Skilled people are more experienced at handling and reducing bad cases.

I think it's good to start with what can fundamentally go wrong but it has you think about what it is. So what's the essence behind a lean process?

1. You need to optimize for resources. Essentially, everyone operates like an economist.
2. You think critically about the consequences of ones position or actions. Perfection isn't possible, but you generally want to approximate in the direction of it.
3. You focus on customer's demands, not imaginations, and you manage resources around the best possible experience for them.
4. You can't be afraid to get rid of things and to repurpose or reform them

That's mostly it. There are other subjects related to the process but those are the general principles. Thinking lean helps you do things without the right amount of resources sometimes, which can be the difference between something happening and nothing happening, so it's pretty useful when you're starting small and wanting to grow large. You might see this in random places, like Mr. Beast's Youtube videos or even some of the actions that make Robots Building Education grow =)
No but really, this was a skill that was introduced to me at a young age when I entered the manufacturing sector. It stayed with more of the years as I entered engineering studies and find myself building software. You may see me do things like randomly blow up a bunch of things I worked on, but that's mostly my style of using this process.
Here's a recent example in the coding crash course:

Another imortant concept to understand is that you're never just limited to one style of development either. There are times where lean mindssets could be the worst possible choice, as was clear for many companies that experience shortages after the pandemic. Sometimes it's valuable to accumulate things and make judgements on them later.
This was also practiced at Robots Building Education when large language model AIs hit the market. You can examine some of the software here: https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/RobotsBuildingEducation/pull/30/files

In a nutshell, it was important to just develop tools to gain insight since frontiers were new and boundaries were fresh. Despite being reasonable products, I still have to make the the right choice of what deserves more software. Here are some of the balancing acts:

1. Should I develop AI software for classrooms, like a tool that supports students raising their hands? Good idea, but not a space I'm in, nor am I aware if this experience is good and appreciated. 
2. Should I develop AI software to create gamified quizzes? Good start, but this would pull resources away from the cirriculum focus, which is the bread and butter that bridges Tiktok and Patreon at the moment.
3. Should I develop AI software to improve the quality of emotion tracking? Yes, this has a measurable impact and it's frontier for student's lifelong journey.

So between 3 important design choices, it makes sense for me to erase the classroom feature and to prioritize AI & Psychology development. 
It also still makes sense to think about quizzing features, which have evolved from an unmanageable product called "Boss Mode" to a feature where students can interact with AI to learn more and to have the quality of their conversation graded.


Well, that's all folks. I wanted to briefly go through this subject matter because many of you are likely interested in building a business and may be curious about how I think about things from a resource perspective. I often mentor folks to have a customer-centric focus when they're building a business, but that doesn't always go into the actual day-to-day functionality and process-making.
Lean work is tried and true and it can be applied to any medium, really, it's mostly a mindset and approach =)
